PREFACE
</p>

<p>
In the following pages are narrated much of real life and
adventure, with much that is historically true; but these
passages I leave to the inquiring reader to discover or to
separate.  The localities are all described from old works
or other sources, as they existed in the time of the hero.
</p>

<p>
Many of the characters are real, and belong to history,
such as the Vicomte de Turenne, De Toneins, Vaudemont,
Raoul d'Ische, the Marechal de la Force, the
Marquis of Gordon, and others.  The Count de Bitche
was also a veritable personage who disgraced those days,
and his abduction of the Countess of Lutzelstein was a
real event.
</p>

<p>
The story of Tushielaw is an old Scottish legend.
</p>

<p>
So great was the French spirit for duelling in that age,
that many of the clergy wore swords.  Thus, in 1617, we
find the Cardinal de Guise <i>drawing his rapier</i> upon the
Duke of Nevers Gonzaga, and it is notorious that
Cardinal de Retz fought a great many duels when, as an
abbé, he was soliciting the Archbishopric of Paris.
</p>

<p>
Some notes of interest, regarding the Scots and Scottish
Guard in France will be found at the end of this Romance,
in which I have endeavoured to portray something of
the free and reckless character of the French court and
army during the reign of Louis XIII.,&mdash;a state of morals
gradually introduced by his more dissolute predecessors,
and which, under the Grand Monarque, increased, together
with tyranny and misgovernment, until the foundations of
the throne were sapped, the old dynasty of France
expatriated, and her nobility destroyed.

<h3>
CHAPTER I.
<br /><br />
THE PRETTY MASK.
</h3>

<p>
It was about the end of April, 1634&mdash;twelve had tolled from
the huge dark towers of Notre Dame, and the night was dark
and gusty.
</p>

<p>
I found myself bewildered among the intricate and gloomy
streets of old Paris; having lost the way to my hotel, the
<i>Golden Fleur de Lys</i>, in the ancient Rue d'Ecosse.  In my
ignorance of the thoroughfares and of their names, having
been repeatedly misled by wicked gamins and practical jokers,
midnight found me completely entangled among the narrow
alleys that bordered on the terrible locality of the Place de la
Grève, the lofty, quaint and peculiar mansions of which
towered on three sides, while on the fourth, lay the Seine,
whose muddy waters have hidden the gashed corpse of many
a murdered man&mdash;have swept away the red débris of many a
massacre, and been the last refuge of many a desperate and
despairing heart.
</p>

<p>
Against the dark sky, I could distinguish the darker outlines
of the steep sharp gables that overhung the Place, with their
fronts covered by grotesque sculptures in wood and stone.
A few lights twinkled feebly amid the masses of that great
pillared edifice of the days of Charles V., named from him.
the Maison au Dauphin; and the flickering oil lamps that
swung mournfully to and fro, at the ends of the dark alley,
cast a sickly light upon the fantastic projections of the houses,
and on the whitewashed turret of the ancient pillory and
stone gibbet, whereon so many thousands of human beings,
during ages past, have died in agony and disgrace.
</p>

<p>
Here then, in this place of pleasant associations, I&mdash;who
had arrived in Paris but the night before&mdash;found myself alone,
wandering in ignorance of the way, at midnight&mdash;I, a Scot
and stranger, with my whole worldly possessions about me,
to wit, ten of those gay louis d'ors (first coined by Louis XIII.),
a good suit of black velvet, a fair cloak of serge de Berri,
worth about ten pistoles; but having a good sword, that had
notched more than one crown in its time, with a pair of steel
Scottish pistols in my girdle engraved with my coat of arms
and the significant legend,
</p>

<p class="poem">
  "He who gives <i>quickly</i>, gives <i>twice</i>."<br />
</p>

<p class="noindent">
Moreover I was only twenty years of age&mdash;active, determined
even to recklessness, and at all times master of my weapons,
if not of my temper.
</p>

<p>
In a secret pocket of my doublet, I carried a letter of
recommendation from Esme Stuart, who was Lord of Aubigne,
Duke of Lennox, Lord High Admiral and Great Chamberlain
of Scotland, to Madame Clara, the mistress of Louis XIII.,
who had created her Comtesse d'Amboise.  In wit and beauty
she was the rival of Ninon de l'Enclos, and the superior of
the lovely Marion de l'Orme, being one of those bold, artful,
and beautiful women who in all ages have entangled the
politics and swayed the destinies of France; and on this
missive from the duke, who had known Madame Clara in her
girlish days, when she was a dame d'honneur, and he a gay
captain of the Scottish archers&mdash;and had known her more
intimately, perhaps, than the most Christian king could have
relished&mdash;all my hope of success in the French service
depended; for by the ruin and misfortunes which their own
patriotism had brought upon my family, I was landless,
homeless, all but penniless and an outcast from my country&mdash;a
country where it is ever the doom and curse of patriotism
and purity of spirit to be stifled and crushed under the heels
of envy, calumny, avarice, and sectarianism.
</p>

<p>
The last note of the vast bell of Notre Dame de Paris, had
pealed away over the darkened city, when I paused and looked
about me.
</p>

<p>
The ends of the streets and alleys were closed by iron chains,
over which I had fallen more than once.  None of the city
watch were visible, and save myself no one seemed abroad, for
I heard no sound save the mournful creaking of the oil lamps,
which swung, few and far between, in the centre of the way,
or the murmur of the river as it chafed against the wooden
abutments of the quay and poured through the arches of the
Pont de Notre Dame.
</p>

<p>
While surveying the river on one side, and the pillared
recesses of the Maison au Dauphin on the other, espying a
fancied lurker in every shadowy depth, all the old stories I
had heard of Paris floated through my mind; for I had been
told that there were quarters of the city, such as the infamous
Cour des Miracles, into which neither the sergeants of the
Provost, nor the officers of the Chatelet dared to
venture&mdash;strongholds of vice and villany, where mohawks, midnight
assassins, house-breakers, cloak-snatchers, cut-purses, Spanish
gypsies, Italian musicians, German mountebanks, Jew vendors
of quack medicine, and women whose fall, like that of angels,
had brought them far from heaven, repaired by day; and
from whence, like a living and pestilent flood, they issued by
night to ensnare, and waylay the unwary and the wandering.
</p>

<p>
Then there were lacqueys, pages, nobles, and gallants, who
went about masked, muffled, and armed to the teeth, fighting
the watch, insulting the peaceful, carrying off pretty girls,
<i>sabre à la main</i>, and committing such outrages that in 1607 it
was computed that since the accession of Henry IV the
number of French gentlemen slain in duels alone amounted
to <i>four thousand</i>.*
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p class="footnote">
* Lomenie&mdash;Mém. Hist. de France.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
I thought of these things, and keeping my cloak well about
me with one hand, kept the other on the pommel of my
sword.
</p>

<p>
Turning to quit the Place de la Grève (I have learned all
the local names since that eventful night), I stood a moment
irresolute whether to take the alley which leads into the
Rue Coutellerie and from thence towards the Faubourg
St. Martin, when a cry arrested my steps.  It seemed to come
from the shadow of Rolande's Tower, an old building half
Roman and half Gothic, in a cell of which Madame de
Rolande, the daughter of a French crusader, died of grief in
the days of St. Louis, and which stands at the corner of the
Place, near the Rue de la Tannerie and close to the river.
</p>

<p>
Then a woman rushed towards me exclaiming,
</p>

<p>
'Monsieur, if you are a gentleman you will protect me!'
</p>

<p>
'With my life, madame,' I replied.
</p>

<p>
'With your sword would be more to the purpose,' said
she, as I took her hand; 'by your voice you are a Scottish
archer?'
</p>

<p>
'Would to heaven I were!  I am but a poor gentleman,
forced to leave his own country and seek military service in
France.'
</p>

<p>
'Your name&mdash;'
</p>

<p>
'Arthur Blane, of Blanerne,&mdash;but who are they that
pursue you?' I asked, while endeavouring to make out her
features, which were partly concealed by a black velvet mask,
through the holes of which her eyes sparkled with no common
animation.  By her voice she seemed young; by her bearing
noble; and by her gloveless hands, which were small, white,
and soft, I was assured that she was beautiful.  'Lady,' I
resumed; 'to where shall I conduct you?'
</p>

<p>
'On your honour, I charge you neither to conduct nor
follow me.'
</p>

<p>
'But you were molested&mdash;'
</p>

<p>
'By two tipsy gallants who, deeming me a grisette, I
presume, have pursued me all the way from the Logis de
Lorraine; but hark! you hear them,&mdash;I must leave you&mdash;'
</p>

<p>
'Alone&mdash;alone and here!'
</p>

<p>
'Yes.'
</p>

<p>
'Oh, madame, think of the hour, the place&mdash;your beauty&mdash;'
</p>

<p>
'Enough; a carriage waits me at the Pont de Notre Dame.'
</p>

<p>
''Tis well,' said I, unsheathing my sword; 'your molesters
shall not pass this way if I can prevent them.'
</p>

<p>
'Oh! a thousand thanks brave sir,' said she with a shudder
on seeing the shining steel, and holding out her ungloved
hand.
</p>

<p>
'Madame, I risk my life for you, and you give me but your
hand to kiss!'
</p>

<p>
'What! do you too take me for a grisette?' she asked with a
haughty smile as she lifted her little mask.  I kissed her
cheek, and in a moment she slipped from my arm and was
gone!  Her face was more than beautiful; but I had no time
to think upon it, and stood sword in hand in the centre of the
Quai de la Grève, barring the passage of two men, cloaked,
masked, and armed, who came boldly up to me, singing with
the brusque air of tipsy roisterers.
</p>

<p><br /><br /><br /></p>

<p><a id="chap02"></a></p>

<h3>
CHAPTER II.
<br /><br />
A CASE OF RAPIERS.
</h3>

<p>
I dreaded being robbed and consequently of perchance losing
the duke's letter to Madame d'Amboise&mdash;a letter which contained
the destiny of my life.  I had nothing valuable to lose
besides but my life, and, strange to say, I valued it less than
my letter.  Wrapped in my cloak, I stood with rapier on
guard right in the centre of the Quai, while the cavaliers
came close up to me.  Both were, as I have said, masked,
armed, and cloaked; and moreover were taller and, to all
appearance, stouter than I.  One was singing that gay and
lively song in which the people of Lower Normandy still
remember the mother of the English conqueror&mdash;the wife of
Herluin, the Comte de Conteville; and his companion joined
vigorously in the gay chorus.
</p>

</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
Pausing in his song, the singer came scornfully up to me
with one hand on his sword and the other on his moustache,
saying,
</p>

<p>
'Pardieu&mdash;you saw one of the most inconstant of God's
creatures pass this way?'
</p>

<p>
'To the point, monsieur,' said I, 'what do you mean?'
</p>

<p>
'A woman&mdash;you saw her?'
</p>

<p>
'Yes,' I replied, still barring the way with my sword.
</p>

<p>
'Pretty, and with a modest air which would have deceived
the devil himself.'
</p>

<p>
'Perhaps so.'
</p>

<p>
'And which way went she?' demanded both imperiously.
</p>

<p>
'My sword is drawn to answer you,' I replied, considerably
ruffled by the brusquerie of their bearing.
</p>

<p>
'Stay, chevalier,' said one, laughing; 'let the poor man
alone&mdash;'tis only some bourgeois seized by a fit of valour.'
</p>

<p>
'Peste, monseigneur, I see by a glance that he is no
bourgeois; and where is his lantern?'
</p>

<p>
'You have drunk like a Swiss to-night, chevalier, and cannot
see it.'
</p>

<p>
'Which way did our little grisette go?' said the other,
unsheathing his sword with a threatening air; 'say, say, or
pardieu, I will spit you like a sparrow.'
</p>

<p>
'Right,' added the other, furiously; 'morbleu! this wearies
me.  Run him through the body if you will&mdash;he is only an
Italian scaramouche by his patois.  Be quick with your work;
for, sabre de bois! it will not do for you or me, to be caught
brawling at night in the capital of Louis XIII. as if we were
at home in Lorraine.'
</p>

<p>
'I am no Italian,' said I, pressing my blade against his; 'I
am a Scottish gentleman, and shall make you pay dearly for
this fanfaronade.'
</p>

<p>
'Peste!' said he, dropping his point for a moment; 'a
Garde de Manche?'
</p>

<p>
'No.'
</p>

<p>
'Pardieu, chevalier,' exclaimed, the other, who seemed bent
on having mischief, ''tis only a Scottish Calvinist, who on his
way to the devil, has visited our good city of Paris.
</p>

<p class="t3">
  'Vive le fils d'Harlette!<br />
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
'Then, have at you, monsieur!'
</p>

<p>
In a moment both our swords were engaged to the hilt;
while he, whose title of monseigneur led me to infer that
his rank was high, remained with his rapier drawn to
see fair play&mdash;but he was so tipsy that he could scarcely stand.
</p>

<p>
Our duel was silent, desperate, and quiet on my part; for I
was highly exasperated by the effrontery and daring with
which these two wild ruffs, regardless of all consequences, had
fastened a quarrel upon me; and I was resolved to punish them
both severely; but my antagonist continued to talk and sing
while making all his lunges, and as his back was turned to a
dim oil lamp that swung behind him, he had considerably the
advantage of me, and took care to retain it; yet I had no fear,
for the famous Count de Forgatz was not a better swordsman
than I.
</p>

<p>
After all I had undergone in my own country&mdash;and this all,
the reader shall know ere long&mdash;the reflection flashed upon
my mind, that Fate would indeed deal hardly with me, if I
should be slain, nameless and unknown, in a street brawl, and
left dead among the offal of Paris, to be carried away to the
Morgue by porters or the watch in the morning.  The very
thought gave new fury to my heart, and fresh nerve to my
arm!  The sword of the French chevalier was longer and
heavier than mine; but thanks to my Scottish education I was
no way his inferior in this desperate game; my slender blade,
twisted and span round his like a serpent; and after an engagement
of three minutes, every thrust he made was successfully
parried.
</p>

<p>
'Tête Dieu!  I came too late to the parry there,' said he, as
my point tore up the lace on the breast of his crimson velvet
pourpoint, and while the blades clashed and rasped on each
other, striking fire in the dark, he sang the last verse of his song.
</p>

<p class="poem">
  'Falaise dans sa vielle tour<br />

<p class="noindent">
'Diable! take care, monsieur, or I am through you&mdash;my
sword is like a spit in the king's kitchen.  Peste! take time,
fellow&mdash;Death himself could not be more impatient than you.
A devil of a thrust that&mdash;our little flash in the pan is really
becoming quite serious!'
</p>

<p>
I pressed so close upon him, that once the bowl-hilts of our
swords touched and rung; but at a moment, when this gay
chevalier, who treated my fencing with such coolness
and contempt, slipped his left foot, and consequently raised
his guard a little, I lunged furiously within, and drove my
sword nearly to the cross guard through his ribs on the right
side.
</p>

<p>
Poor wretch! he uttered a sound something between a sob
and a cry, while instinctively I drew back my blade to parry
the return his hand could never give me now.  His eyes
glared and closed, the sword dropped from his fingers, and,
deluged in blood, he sunk upon the causeway.
</p>

<p>
I found myself face to face with a dying man, and this
cooled us all.
</p>

<p>
'Monsieur,' said his companion, hurriedly, 'we have been
to blame; you are a stranger, fly!'
</p>

<p>
'Whither?' I asked, wildly; 'I have already lost my way.'
</p>

<p>
'Morbleu! you will find it soon enough; to the Bastille, if
the watch overtake you!'
</p>

<p>
This dreadful word <i>Bastille</i> gave me fresh resolution.
</p>

<p>
'Away, away, monsieur!' gasped the wounded man, half
choked in his blood; 'take this ring&mdash;' he struggled to get it
off his finger; 'oh, Monseigneur le Prince, give him this&mdash;my
ring; the lieutenant of the watch is my friend&mdash;away!  I
have known a man branded with the fleur de lys, and broken
alive on the wheel, for less than this.'
</p>

<p>
'If taken, show the ring of the chevalier to the lieutenant,
and you will be allowed to pass.'
</p>

<p>
'But we must see each other again&mdash;'
</p>

<p>
'Trust to heaven for that,' gasped the wounded man, adding
generously, 'away!  I hear footsteps&mdash;'tis the watch!'
</p>

<p>
'Forgive me, Chevalier,' said I, trembling with emotion,
'but this quarrel was not of my seeking.'
</p>

<p>
'From my soul I forgive you, but begone.'
</p>

<p>
'Farewell!'
</p>

<p>
And with this word I turned and fled, just as a mounted
patrol of the watch turned the corner of the Rue de la
Mortellerie, and entered the Place de la Grève.

CHAPTER III.
<br /><br />
THE CHATEAU.
</h3>

<p>
'In the affairs of every one,' says a French writer, 'there is a
moment which decides upon his future.  It is almost always
chance, which takes a man as the wind does a leaf, and throws
him into some new and unknown path, where, once entered,
he is obliged to obey a superior force, and where, while
believing himself free, he is but <i>the slave of circumstances, and
the plaything of events</i>.'
</p>

<p>
I have been much struck by the force and truth of this
passage, which seems to bear directly upon my own career in
life:&mdash;to resume.
</p>

<p>
A long, dark, and narrow street, lighted by only two
lanterns that flickered like glow-worms at each end of it, led
me towards the Rue St. Antoine; and heedless of everything
but the desire to leave Paris, I hurried along the deserted
thoroughfares, with a swimming head and a sickened heart.
</p>

<p>
The streets of Paris, like those of London, were then in a
deplorable condition; unpaved, and encumbered by heaps of
rubbish and cinders, the daily débris of the household, that
festered in the stagnant gutters and watercourses, with the
blood of the slaughter-booths, all matted and plashed by the
feet of passengers, the hoofs of horses, and the wheels of
waggons, carriages, and fiacres.  Many of the tortuous and
intricate alleys were literally dunghills.  In the deep central
gutters the swine revelled, and contested with kites and crows,
dogs and beggars, for the offal of Paris.  A French prince
of the royal blood was killed in the city by a privileged pig of
St. Anthony running between the legs of his horse; the
splendid rider was brought prone into the mud with a broken
neck.  Moreover, in this good city every variety of slops and
utensils were emptied nightly over the windows, with the
same warning cry that was used in Scottish towns, and which
never failed to strike the belated with alarm&mdash;<i>Gardez l'eau!</i>
</p>

<p>
I dashed on, my sword still unsheathed, leaping the chains
at the ends of the greater thoroughfares; on past the Porte
St. Antoine, unseen by the watch, unchallenged by the sentinels,
and leaving the town behind me, hurried along a country
road, which afterwards proved to be the way to Vincennes.
At length the fields, the trees, and solitude were around me,
and I paused to draw breath, and look back to where the vastness
of Paris, like a wilderness of stone, lay buried in sleep,
and overtopped by the huge dark towers of Notre Dame.
</p>

<p>
Another black and frowning mass rose above the roofs and
spires: it resembled the keep of a castle.  I remembered the
Bastille, that place of dreadful memories; and when recalling
the rank of those I had so recently encountered, for one had
been termed <i>chevalier</i>, and the other <i>monseigneur</i>, I felt more
than one retrospective pang of anxiety or panic, and while
endeavouring to imagine in what part of yonder wilderness my
antagonist was lying, I turned my back upon it, and, with a
glow of sad and fierce satisfaction, inhaled the free, pure
breeze that came over the fallow fields.  The sound of hoofs
made me pause, listen eagerly, and then hurriedly to pierce a
hedge and leave the road; for a mounted party, to my
consternation too evidently the night patrol bent in pursuit of
me, galloped along the highway.  I had the ring of the
discomfited chevalier, but I cared not to test its virtue on the
lieutenant of police.
</p>

<p>
After wandering for nearly an hour in a park or lawn, the
smooth and grassy level of which was broken at intervals by
thickets of trees and shrubbery, I found myself close to a
large and handsome château.  Its turreted façade cut the sky,
and its numerous vanes of gilt copper were creaking in the
wind, as I ascended the paved and balustraded terrace, which
formed a broad plateau around the walls.  The edifice formed
three sides of a quadrangle; the centre was evidently
appropriated to the principal inmates; but the whole was covered
by rich carving, coats of arms, florid cornices and gablets.
The wings were apparently the residence of servants, with the
stables and offices.  On the highest slate-roofed turret creaked
a large swallow-tailed vane&mdash;in fact, a girouette, which, of
old, was permitted only to those of the ancient French noblesse
who had been foremost in entering a breach, or planting his
pennon on a hostile rampart&mdash;hence the modern vane.
</p>

<p>
This stately château was nearly all sunk in gloom; one or
two lights amid its sombre masses alone pierced the darkness;
and, fearing to be taken for a robber, and perhaps fired on by
the arquebuse of some pot-valiant butler or officious lacquey,
I stood upon the paved terrace, irresolute whether to strike
the bell at the porter's lodge, or retire altogether; but an end
was put to my indecision, when a curtain was suddenly
withdrawn at one of the large windows on the ground-floor; a
flood of light streamed across the terrace and lawn, and the
figure of a handsome woman, richly dressed, was seen for a
moment, as she peered inquiringly into the darkness without.
</p>

<p>
As she withdrew and the curtain fell from her hand, but
without completely closing, I approached softly and peeped
in, for in my present desperate emergency I was resolved to
trust rather to the advice and protection of a woman than of a
man.
</p>

<p>
The apartment was small, and richly decorated in the florid
French taste: I took in the whole scene at a glance.  The
walls were hung with the finest specimen of Gobelin tapestry,
representing the judgment of Solomon.  The chairs were
cushioned with pale-blue satin, fringed with silver, and, like
the tables, they were richly gilt.  On a buhl table stood a
gorgeous silver lamp, the soft light of which fell on the figures
of two ladies.  One was tall, high-bosomed, and round-armed&mdash;full
and ample every way, even to voluptuousness.  She
seemed to be about thirty-five years of age, and had magnificent
eyes, with a bewitching droop in their long lashes, and an
irresistible smile over all her face.  Her complexion was
brilliant, and her manner was full of vivacity.  She wore a
green silk dress, starred with gold; and carried in her jewelled
hand a large fan of painted feathers.  Her fingers, her chesnut
hair, her bosom and taper arms were sparkling with diamonds;
and by the richness of her costume, and the languid air that
pervaded her manner, I supposed that she had just returned
from some brilliant Parisian fête.
</p>

<p>
Her companion was a fair young girl with white shoulders,
and a complexion of excessive delicacy; soft and pale, but it
seemed the pallor of high birth and gentle breeding, rather
than want of health.  Her hair, which hung about her in
great volume, was of the lightest auburn; thus her ringlets
shone like clusters of gold in the lamplight; her eyes were a
deep blue or violet colour, and their brows and lashes a
dark-brown tint.  Her attire was singularly plain; in one hand she
carried a thick serge mantle; in the other a black velvet mask.
</p>

<p>
She was excited apparently, for she spoke in low and
hurried tones, while delivering certain letters and papers to
the taller lady, who might have passed for her aunt or elder
sister; yet there was no resemblance in face or manner
between them.
</p>

<p>
Unwilling to play the eavesdropper even for a moment, I
tapped gently on the window.
</p>

<p>
The younger lady uttered a faint cry of alarm, and assumed
her mask; but the elder thrust all the papers into her ample
bosom, and coming resolutely forward, threw back the rich
arras, and her eyes flashed with evident anger, astonishment,
and perhaps alarm, when they met my figure immediately
outside the window; but, with my broad beaver in my left hand,
and my right pressed upon my heart, I bowed with the utmost
respect, and muttered a few words, I know not what, by way
of apology for my untimely appearance there.
</p>

<p>
Reassured by my aspect or my respectful bearing, she
quickly opened the folding sash of the window, and from the
apartment and her presence a sense of perfume floated round
me.
</p>

<p>
'Who are you, monsieur, and what seek you here?' she
asked in a charming voice.
</p>

<p>
'Alas, madame!' said I, feeling that sad sinking of a proud
heart, which all but prostrates every energy, for never until
then had my utter friendlessness so oppressed me; 'I am an
unfortunate gentleman,&mdash;a stranger who has lost his way, and
knows not in which direction to turn.'
</p>

<p>
'This is the Château d'Amboise; the way to Paris lies
yonder,&mdash;straight across the lawn you will find the high-road,
and then pursue it to your left.'
</p>

<p>
'Thanks, madame&mdash;
</p>

<p>
'I have the honour to wish you a good night, monsieur.'
</p>

<p>
'Stay, madame, and pardon me&mdash;'  I paused and cast down
my eyes.
</p>

<p>
'Speak&mdash;what would you say?'
</p>

<p>
'Within this hour I have had to fly from Paris, pursued by
the watch.'
</p>

<p>
'Ah&mdash;indeed!' she said, suspiciously.
</p>

<p>
'Having become involved in a brawl while protecting a
fugitive female from two drunken gallants who were pursuing
her, I was roughly set upon, and had the misfortune to&mdash;to&mdash;'
</p>

<p>
'To&mdash;what, monsieur?'
</p>

<p>
'Run one through the body.'
</p>

<p>
'And this was in the Place de la Grève, where the great
pillory stands?' said the lady.
</p>

<p>
'It was close to the bridge of the Seine.'
</p>

<p>
'Ah! the Pont de Notre Dame?'
</p>

<p>
'Yes, madame.'
</p>

<p>
'Mon Dieu! how strange!  Nicola, behold your preserver.
Poor boy&mdash;for you are but a boy&mdash;how pale you look!  Step
in&mdash;quick my friend&mdash;tell me all this affair over again; and
Nicola, hand him some wine; when I took you into my coach
at the Pont de Notre Dame, how little we thought that one of
your pursuers was being run through the body; but it served
him right, the insolent&mdash;quite right!'
</p>

<p>
I entered by the window and the curtains were closed
behind; and in the younger lady, who had so hastily assumed
her disguise, and who tremblingly handed to me a glass of
wine, I recognised my pretty friend, the mask of the Place de
la Grève; and I remarked that the hand which gave me the
glass, was small, white, and delicate as a lily leaf.
</p>

<p>
'You shall remain here until pursuit is over,' said the lady,
approaching a hand-bell; but suddenly she paused; her brow
clouded and her eyes sparkled.  'Oh, monsieur, if all this
story be but the trick of a gallant, who may have
followed us&mdash;'
</p>

<p>
'Madame!' I exclaimed, and drew myself up angrily.
</p>

<p>
'Enough, monsieur&mdash;forgive me; 'twas but the thought of
a moment, and this Paris of ours is so full of tricks and
tricksters.  My house is yours&mdash;be assured, sir, it is large
enough for us both.'
</p>

<p>
'May I ask to whom I have the honour of being indebted?'
</p>

<p>
She gave me one of her beautiful but inexplicable smiles,
as she replied,
</p>

<p>
'I am Madame Clara d'Ische.'
</p>

<p>
'The Countess d'Amboise?
</p>

<p>
'Yes.'
</p>

<p>
'Oh, madame!' I exclaimed; 'this is a happy fatality! it
is on you, and you only, that all my hopes in France depend.'
</p>

<p>
'On me?' she said, while her fine eyes dilated with
astonishment, and I drew from my secret pocket the letter of the
Duke of Lennox.
</p>

<p>
'Exiled from my own country, madame, for reasons which
I can easily explain, I am most anxious to obtain military
employment in one of the Scottish regiments of King Louis;
and his Grace the Duke of Lennox favoured me with this letter
of recommendation to you, saying that in Paris you were all
powerful, and that Paris is France.'
</p>

<p>
She held out her hand, and as the trimmings of rich lace
fell back to her elbow, she displayed an arm of dazzling
whiteness, as with a proud and gratified smile she received
and opened the letter of the duke.  Its tenor and conception
were no doubt complimentary and gallant; and perhaps it
referred to old remembered days and passages of love between
them in other times; for a half-repressed sigh escaped her;
her fine eyelids drooped; a half blush flitted across her cheek
with a soft smile of pleasure.  Folding it hastily, she placed it
in her bosom, and bending her bright hazel eyes upon me, said.
</p>

<p>
'Believe, monsieur, that all my little interest is wholly at
your service.'
</p>

<p>
'Ah, Madame la Comtesse, how shall I thank you!'
</p>

<p>
'You will soon learn, monsieur,' and the eyelids drooped
again to veil a cunning smile.
</p>

<p>
'The Duke informed me that you had but to express a wish,
and his majesty King Louis would grant it&mdash;even were it to
go to war with the empire.'
</p>

<p>
'His Grace of Lennox is almost right.  Here at our French
court the ladies guide the men, and have all their several
departments in the science of government and intrigue.'
</p>

<p>
'So I have heard, madame.'
</p>

<p>
'Thus, the tender and pious Mademoiselle de Saujon has
charge of Monseigneur le Duc d'Orleans; Madame de
Chatillon, lively, tender, and black-eyed, has especial dominion
over the Duc de Nemours and the great Prince of Condé;
Mademoiselle de Chevreuse commands the amorous little
Coadjutor Bishop of Paris; the tall, ample, fair, and dazzling
Montbazon, with her snow-white shoulders, and bosom like a
Juno, looks after the Duc de Beaufort; Madame de Longoville,
with her saucy blue eyes, has charge of the Duc de Rochefoucault
and le Marquis de Gordon, Captain of the Scottish guard;
while that brilliant little blonde, the Duchesse de Bouillon,
has a more terrible task than all assigned her&mdash;what is it, dear
Nicola?'
</p>

<p>
'She actually looks after her own husband.'
</p>

<p>
'But, madame,' said I, 'in this catalogue of political
beauties you forget yourself.  You govern&mdash;'
</p>

<p>
'The King!' she replied with a triumphant smile that
made her seem irresistibly beautiful; but the reply was
whispered in my ear so closely that I started with confusion.
</p>

<p>
'So said the Duke of Lennox, adding, "she has but to
smile, and the commander of the Scots will give you a pair of
colours at once."'
</p>

<p>
'There M. le Duc de Lennox overrated my influence, for
old M. de la Ferte Imbault, who has just been appointed
Colonel-General des Ecossais, is a venerable military bear, who
served under Henri Champernon and the Marshal de Tavannes,
and is so old that 'tis said he really remembers the last
tournament in the Place de Carrousel; so on him my smiles would
be lavished in vain.  Yet, take courage&mdash;I am your friend,
and you have this night done me a greater service than you
are aware of.  Take some more wine&mdash;you still look pale,'
said she, passing her soft warm hand caressingly over my
cheek and forehead; 'but now tell me&mdash;and pray excuse the
question&mdash;have you ever&mdash;'
</p>

<p>
'What, madame?'
</p>

<p>
'Been in love?'
</p>

<p>
The blood mounted to my temples as I almost quailed under
the keen eye of the beautiful questioner, and felt my heart
beat strongly&mdash;almost wildly, though she was my senior by at
least fifteen years.
</p>

<p>
'In love&mdash;no, madame; but why that question?'
</p>

<p>
'Because to be successful now, in France, you must study
the art, or rather theory of love as assiduously as that of war.
You must learn to laugh at everything&mdash;to blush at nothing,
and to fight with every man who affronts you; but pardon me,
I am forgetting the proverb&mdash;<i>fier comme un Ecossais</i>!  Among
us in Paris, an assignation and a campaign are nearly of equal
importance; and love sheds its divine halo over everything.
As Cervantes says, a soldier without a mistress is like a ship
without a rudder, or a pilot without his compass.  Thus
M. de Chatillon is so enamoured of the lovely Mademoiselle le
Guerchi that he wears one of her silk garters round his right
arm in battle; and should you fall in love with me, I will
give you one of mine.'
</p>

<p>
'Oh, madame!' I murmured, overpowered by the beauty of
the speaker and perplexed by the strange morality she
displayed&mdash;a code which I now heard for the first time.
</p>

<p>
'And Monseigneur le Duc de Bellegarde, Peer and Marshal
of France, the declared lover of the Queen Regent, before
taking leave of her Majesty, to command the army on the
frontiers, prayed, that as a parting favour she would lay her
beautiful hand but once on the hilt of his sword.  Thus it is,
we still foster the spirit of gallantry which Anne of Austria
brought among us from old Castille and the cavaliers of
Madrid.  But while I am running on in this way, monsieur
my friend, I am quite forgetting that the night has passed,
that the morning draws on apace, and that, as you have never
been in love, it could not be an affair of the heart which made
you leave your country so young.  What was it then?'
</p>

<p>
'An affair of the dagger, madame,' said I, with a bitter
sigh.
</p>

<p>
'Drink again, refresh yourself, and collect your thoughts
before you speak.'
</p>

<p>
And while doing so, I will here insert a little paragraph
for my reader's information.
</p>

<p>
His Majesty, Louis XIII., though not very much of a lover,
sometimes did take a liking to the fair sex.  His regard for
Mademoiselle de la Fayette, a maid of honour to his queen,
was notoriously known, but he was a man at times religious,
weak, bigoted, scrupulous by fits, and not over-voluptuous by
nature; hence, save for the honour his royal regard was
supposed to confer, and the magnificent gifts it drew forth,
his gallantries were neither dangerous nor much in request.
His confessor, the Jesuit Coussin, permitted his mild liaison
for the charming Fayette to favour the queen-mother's rival,
and mademoiselle being in the interest of the minister,
Cardinal Richelieu, smiled on the vapid love and clumsy
gallantries of the most Christian king.  But the tide of
politics turned; and by desire of the Cardinal, and by the
exordiums of Father Leslie, a Scot, who succeeded Coussin as
keeper of the royal conscience, the beautiful Fayette was
immured in a convent.  Then his Majesty of France fell in
love with Clara d'Ische, a lady of Lorraine, whom he created
Countess d'Amboise; and on her, now, were the eagle eyes
of Richelieu turned, to discover by what means she might be
made subservient to himself or be crushed for ever.  Thus,
thanks to the secret agency of his familiar, Father Joseph du
Tremblay, of terrible memory, nearly every servant in her
château was the spy of the Cardinal Prime-minister, who,
with what truth I say not, was at that moment accounted the
lover of Anne of Austria and of Marion de l'Orme.

CHAPTER IV.
<br /><br />
THE BOND OF MANRENT.
</h3>

<p>
Madame, who never tired of prattling, spoke again:
</p>

<p>
'The letter of my dear old friend the Duke&mdash;by-the by,
does he still curl his mustachios up to his ears?&mdash;says that
your father was&mdash;'
</p>

<p>
'Blane of that ilk and of Blanerne, madame, in the
Stewartry of Kirkcudbright, Bailie of Tungland Abbey, and
Captain of Carlaveroc for John Earl of Nithsdale.'
</p>

<p>
'Ma foi! he has as many guttural titles as a Spanish
grandee of the first class; but pray tell me, what does that ilk
mean?'
</p>

<p>
'In the Scottish language it denotes, madame, that the
holder has either given his name to the territory he possesses,
or has taken his name from it; moreover, that he is the head
of his surname.  Our old baronial houses alone bear it, for it
is a custom dating from the days of king Malcolm III., and
consequently is more than six hundred years old.  My father's
office of captainrie under the Earl of Nithsdale was, in some
measure, the cause of all our misfortunes and of my exile.'
</p>

<p>
'Proceed, pray, for I am all attention.'
</p>

<p>
'He was an old adherent of the house of Nithsdale, and
with the present Earl, the Lord Torthorwald, and six other
gentlemen of the surnames of Maxwell, Douglas, and Blane,
signed, about six years ago, a <i>Bond of Manrent</i>&mdash;'
</p>

<p>
'Excuse me, M. Blane&mdash;but I do not understand.'
</p>

<p>
'It means a bond of friendship and alliance, to the effect
that they bound themselves to stand by each other, in peace and
in war, in weal and woe, with all the might of their estates,
castles, and retainers, in arms against all men; the cause of
each to be the cause of all; and to this deed, which is now in
the charter-room of Carlaveroc, they swore by their honours
and souls, affixing thereto their signatures and seals.'
</p>

<p>
'This seemed somewhat like a league against the king.'
</p>

<p>
'Nay, madame, such bonds have been common in Scotland
for ages, and have arisen from the wish to create a feudal
relation between lords and vassals who have no affinity by
tenure, and to strengthen the weak against the strong.  Such
leagues are certainly contrary to the laws of the land, yet they
exist.  But a time came to test the strength of my father's
bond with the Earl of Nithsdale.  King Charles being madly
devoted to his father's rash project of assimilating the kirk of
Scotland, in point of ceremony and in government, to the
Church of England, with regular gradations of titled clergy,
lately resolved, by an Act of Revocation, to resume and
appropriate to the crown all the tithes and benefices which
the barons and other laymen had seized during the plunder of
temporalities at the Reformation; and from these he proposed
to endow the intended Scottish episcopal bishoprics, deaneries,
rectories, and so forth.  The rage of our fiery barons was
great, and their resolution was not less than their rage.
There were many whose whole estates and possessions had
been church property, and thus it was with us, for most of my
father's barony of Blanerne had in ancient times been a fief of
the Abbots of Tungland, and was of course comprehended in
this new and most obnoxious resumption, though it had been
a free gift to his grandfather by the Regent Lennox, and the
Lords of the Congregation, for his valour at the great siege of
Leith, where he routed and slew the Colonel-General of the
Italian infantry.
</p>

<p>
'The intended Revocation was to be announced to the
Convention of Estates by the king's representative in Scotland,
the Lord High Commissioner, who was, unhappily for us, the
Earl of Nithsdale; but certain of the Scottish lords and
barons were determined to kill him before the assembled
Parliament, and then appeal to arms rather than yield to a
measure so impoverishing and obnoxious; and despite the
Bond of Manrent, friendship, and alliance, which bound him
with sword and service, soul and body to the Earl of Nithsdale,
and to whatever cause he espoused, my father, Sir Arthur
Blane, joined the resisting barons in their deadly purpose, and
defied the Maxwells, at all times a desperate and a turbulent
race.  My father was wroth alike with the government of the
kirk and kingdom under Nithsdale, and the suspicion of the
Convention of Estates was first brought upon him thus:&mdash;Having
inscribed above the door of his tower a legend which
seemed to reflect upon the Presbyterian Kirk, he was
imprisoned for a month in the castle of Lochmaben, because
he did not know Latin.'
</p>

<p>
'Ma foi! a droll reason.'
</p>

<p>
'It is not to be wondered at when we all know that a few
years ago Robert Earl of Orkney lost his head for the same
heinous crime.  My father was released, but the affront
rankled in his mind.  It was resolved to poniard the Lord
High Commissioner on the throne, at the moment when the
last word of the royal letter was read; and the contention
for this desperate office&mdash;for who should <i>Bell-the-Cat</i>&mdash;was
so keen, that lots were cast, and ere long the lots were
reduced to two&mdash;my father, Sir Arthur Blane of Blanerne,
and Sir Robert Douglas of Spot, Viscount of Belhaven, an
aged peer who was stone blind, and who, in his youth, had been
master of the horse to the Duke of Rothsay, a gentleman of the
bedchamber to James VI., and member of the Privy Council.
To him only would my father yield place, for in other
years they had been old comrades and served together in
France.
</p>

<p>
'So the terrible and eventful day came at last; the
Parliament met at Edinburgh with unusual grandeur and gloom;
four hundred representatives of the Scottish people were there,
with darkened brows, with angry hearts and sharp swords by
their sides.  The commissioner sat upon the throne; before
him lay the crown, the sword of state, the sceptre and all the
royal insignia; but behind stood the blind old Viscount of
Belhaven holding his velvet robes by the left hand on pretence
that, being aged and infirm, he wished to be near the Lord
Nithsdale.  His other hand was concealed in his bosom, and
firmly grasped a dagger.  Beside him stood my stern father,
who, that he might not be unemployed, had taken upon him
the task of slaying the Viscount Ayr, whom the king had
created Earl of Dumfries, and who was a warm adherent of
the intended Revocation&mdash;'
</p>

<p>
'Mon Dieu!' exclaimed Madame d'Amboise; 'I never
heard of all this stabbing and assassination!'
</p>

<p>
'Because, madame, the proposed tragedy went no further
than this terrible tableau; for the Earl of Nithsdale had
learned something of what was awaiting him and other friends
of our alien king; and after proceeding with the usual business
of the parliament, he closed it abruptly, without producing the
letter of revocation which would have plunged all Scotland
into civil war; and after despatching messengers into Nithsdale,
he returned&mdash;yea almost fled&mdash;to the court at London.'
</p>

<p>
'What meant the messengers?'
</p>

<p>
'You shall hear,' said I, making a violent effort to control
the rage and grief that swelled in my breast; 'within a week
after the closing of parliament my poor father was found dead
on the verge of Lochar-moss&mdash;pierced by three balls from an
arquebuse; and on that night our tower of Blanerne was
burned to the ground, and all the country around it made
desolate by six hundred mosstroopers of the Maxwell clan.
Breaking through them sword in hand, after seeing my only
living relative, a boy-brother about six years old, perish in the
flames, I reached Edinburgh to lay my complaints before the
authorities, but found them all the creatures of the king&mdash;a
king Scottish by birth and blood, but English by breeding,
residence, and sympathy!  Oh cursed be the hour when Scotland
gave a king unto her enemies!  I appealed to the Secretary of
State, but he was my good Lord Nithsdale's fast friend and
near kinsman, so he smiled in my face.  I appealed to the
Lord Advocate; he was my Lord Dumfries' cousin, and bade
me complain to the king in London.  Being a placeman and
a coward, he taunted my murdered father's memory; so I
smote him on the mouth with my sword-hilt&mdash;yea, smote him
down as I would have done a dog, and had again to fly.
Destruction and pursuit dogged me close; but aided by the
kind old Duke of Lennox, a kinsman of my mother, I obtained
the letter which you hold and also shipping to Havre.  There
I landed safely, and found lodging with a countryman of my
own, an honest vintner, who met me wandering sadly and
irresolutely from street to street.  He accosted me, as
Scotsmen always greet each other in a foreign land, for his heart
warmed to the St. Andrew's cross in my bonnet&mdash;and he was more
than kind to me.  I then took the public messenger to Paris,
agreeing for fifteen francs to have a horse, lodgings, and food
on the way; but I had to give the conductor a piece of
thirteen sols.  I reached Paris only last night, when an honest
fellow, who proved to be an Englishman and a Protestant,
guided me to an hotel, the Golden Fleur-de-lys in the Rue
d'Ecosse.  I spent the next day in wandering about the
palace and gardens of the Luxembourg and the royal library,
seeing the books of miniatures done by Monsieur Robert, the
garden of the Tuileries, and the church of Notre Dame,
the two massy towers, the antiquity and gloom of which
charmed and soothed me; but alas, madame!  I felt lonely and
sad amid the roar and bustle of this vast and crowded city; I
was ready to weep&mdash;yea, to weep like a child, when I thought
of my ruined fortunes, my blighted family, and my father's
ancient tower that looked down upon the Dee, and my native
hills and heather braes that were far, far away!'
</p>

<p>
'And did you travel comfortably to Paris?'
</p>

<p>
'With more frugality than comfort, madame, remembering
that he who sleeps without supper awakes without debt.'
</p>

<p>
'My poor boy! you will soon learn that two things are
most necessary in this good and pious city of Paris&mdash;a drawn
sword and a golden wand.  But tell me,' she added, with a
coquettish smile, and while dropping her voice and her
eyelashes together, 'are you capable of feeling a deep
love?'
</p>

<p>
'Love?' I reiterated a second time, while my heart vibrated
strongly, and I perceived the fair mask beside us, who had
listened to all this in silence, turn away with a gesture of
ineffable disdain.
</p>

<p>
'Well, well, M. Blane, I will talk to you of this another
time,' said the countess, who detected this secret displeasure in
her friend or companion; 'a deep love is not necessary, if
you are only adequate to a little pretty wickedness, or amiable
weakness, it is quite enough here&mdash;for we do not love long in
these days of ours.  Believe me that his Grace of Lennox
shall be obeyed, and that I will leave nothing undone to find
you a suitable position in France.'
</p>

<p>
'Oh madame, a thousand thanks!' I exclaimed, remembering,
with something of remorse, that I had once felt considerable
disdain for the character of the patroness to whom my ducal
kinsman had assigned me.
</p>

<p>
'What say you to join the Duke of Lorraine?' she asked
abruptly.
</p>

<p>
'Lorraine, madame?' I stammered.
</p>

<p>
'Yes.'
</p>

<p>
'He is said to be in league with the German emperor
against the King of France,' said the masked lady hurriedly.
</p>

<p>
'Well, mademoiselle&mdash;and what then?'
</p>

<p>
'Ah, madame la Comtesse, do not trepan the poor youth
into a service of which he is ignorant, or into a hazardous game
like that now played by France and Lorraine.'
</p>

<p>
'As you please,' replied the Countess pettishly.  'Mademoiselle
Marie Louise of Lorraine, the duke's only daughter
and favourite child, is said to be now in Paris, and to have
won over more than twenty colonels of the French army to
her father's cause.'
</p>

<p>
'Pardon me, madame,' said I, 'but remember that a
Scottish subject cannot serve with honour against a king of
France.'
</p>

<p>
'Then your wishes&mdash;'
</p>

<p>
'Are military service under King Louis.  My father served
as a lieutenant in the Gensdarmes Ecossais for ten years, and
fought at the siege of Rochelle, where the Huguenots insisted
on holding their assembly; at the storming of the castle of
Sully, and the blockade of Caumont.  I should like a
commission in the same force.'
</p>

<p>
'May I ask what money you have?'
</p>

<p>
'Only ten louis d'ors.'
</p>

<p>
She gave me a beautiful smile, and said,
</p>

<p>
'My dear child, you do not know that a captaincy in the
Scottish gendarmerie or cuirassiers costs one hundred and
eighty thousand livres, being forty-five thousand more than a
troop <i>in any other</i> regiment of horse, even the gendarmerie
of Bourguignon or Flanders; a cornetcy in the Scottish troop
costs sixty-two thousand livres.  You must moderate your
ambition, and be contented with the post of a simple cuirassier,
for in the ranks of the Scottish guard, horse and foot, are none
but the noblest and best blood of your own country; thus
your rank and pay as a Scottish cuirassier will enable you to
ruffle it in Paris with any gallant or chevalier about court.  I
shall send for the captain, or write to the colonel-general of
the Scots in the morning, when our wishes shall be complied
with&mdash;provided there be a vacancy.
</p>

<p>
'Madame,' I exclaimed, overcome by the sweetness and
decision of her manner, as much as by its kindness and the
brilliance of her beauty, 'the devotion of my life shall be
yours.'
</p>

<p>
I drew from my finger the only jewel I possessed&mdash;the ring
obtained that night so strangely and disastrously in the Place
de la Grève; and as it seemed to be a valuable diamond, I
was about to place it on her finger, when the sound of a
carriage driven furiously up the avenue, a slamming of doors,
the tramp of feet and voices of men who seemed somewhat
excited, gradually approached the apartment in which we
were seated.  The Countess grew very pale.
</p>

<p>
'Can this be the King?' she exclaimed.
</p>

<p>
'Oh, no,' said her attendant, who trembled excessively;
'there are no torches and no musketeers; 'tis not his
Majesty.'
</p>

<p>
'Away, my friend,' said the Countess, clasping her hands;
and while the masked lady retired in evident alarm, I laid
hand on my sword.
</p>

<p>
'Can my brother have come here at this untimeous hour?'
muttered the Countess, as a servant entered with a hurried and
disordered air.
</p>

<p>
'Ah, Madame la Comtesse&mdash;&mdash;'
</p>

<p>
'Mon Dieu!  what is the matter?  Speak, Antoine&mdash;speak!'
</p>

<p>
'Your brother, madame&mdash;M. le Chevalier d'Ische&mdash;has this
moment been brought hither in a fiacre almost dead, having
fought with a brigand on the Quai de la Grève, and been run
through the body!'
</p>

<p>
'My brother!' exclaimed Madame d'Amboise, growing pale
as a lily, and turning her eyes wildly upon me; and at that
moment, when I saw a wounded man borne by four servants
past an opening in the parted arras, I felt as if the earth was
yawning beneath my feet.
</p>

<p>
So ended my first night in the city of Paris!
</p>

<p><br /><br /><br /></p>

<p><a id="chap05"></a></p>

<h3>
CHAPTER V.
<br /><br />
THE COUNTESS'S BOUDOIR.
</h3>

<p>
I was hastily conducted to a chamber by Antoine, the servant
who had brought this alarming intelligence, and who marched
before me, bearing two tall candles of pink wax, bowing to
his knees at every second step.  I inquired if the chevalier
who had just been brought hither was dangerously wounded.
Antoine replied, that he was speechless, pale, and pierced near
the right lung; but a skilful surgeon had announced that
he believed the patient would be out of danger in a day
or two.
</p>

<p>
This was some comfort, and when the valet left me,
I threw off my clothes; but frequently pausing during the
process of disrobing, I looked around me with a vague
misbelief of my own identity; nor did the pallor of my face and
the wild expression of my eyes, as I surveyed myself in a huge
mirror that was bordered by an old Flemish marqueterie frame
mounted with ormulu, quite reassure me that I was not
myself, but somebody else.
</p>

<p>
Opposite hung a quaint picture of a tall dame, with one of
those steeple-like coifs worn by Parisian ladies in the days of
the unhappy dauphiness Margaret of Scotland, and Isabella
of Bavaria.
</p>

<p>
I was really in the house of the king's powerful mistress&mdash;the
famous Countess d'Amboise&mdash;she to whom my carefully-treasured
letter had been addressed&mdash;she who held in her fair,
plump hands even more than the wary and subtle Richelieu the
balance of peace and war between France and the empire;
and she who had promised to me her protection, and more
than protection, her kindest favour; but, while her guest, I
knew myself to be perhaps the destroyer of a brother to whom
she was evidently sincerely attached!  I threw myself into the
bed of soft down, and under its canopy of plumes and gilding
strove to sleep, to forget that I was weary, and that daybreak
was almost at hand; but an hour or more elapsed before the
highbacked marqueterie chairs of Utrecht velvet, or the huge
tapestry on the walls faded away, as the night lamp burned
dim, and assuredly the misshapen figures on the arras were
ghastly enough!  They represented Louis XI., surrounded by
his principal soldiers, placing around the neck of Launay de
Morville the collar of his own military order, as the reward of
valour and prowess in the field; and the whole group in their
fleur-de-lised surcoats vibrated slowly and with a lifelike
motion in the cold wind which found entrance by a hundred
crannies; for the château was old, having been built by
Jacques d'Amboise, abbot of Chigny, in 1490.  It had been
enlarged and remodelled by the Duc de Sully, who was Grand
Master of the king's artillery in 1599, and who decorated the
walls in the most florid style of French architecture.  Here,
too, dwelt Louis de Clermont de Bussy d'Amboise, so famous
for his accomplishments and valour, and who, at an assignation
with the beautiful Madame de Montresor was most unpleasantly
slain by her husband and his valets.  Latterly it had been a
residence of the princely house of Guise in Lorraine, and on
being sold by them, was bought by the king, and by him
bestowed with a patent of nobility upon Clara d'Ische.
Since then, as a protection against robbers and lovers, it was
usually protected by twenty of the grey musketeers; but,
fortunately for me, on this night the usual guard had been
withdrawn, as the French troops were all moving towards
Lorraine.
</p>

<p>
The next morning was somewhat advanced, when the same
attendant, Antoine, who appeared to be greatly trusted by the
countess, came to dress me, and brought me a cup of hot
coffee, which, for breakfast, I preferred to the poor thin wine
and cold sliced meat usually taken by the Parisians.
</p>

<p>
I inquired for the wounded chevalier.
</p>

<p>
'He had been pronounced out of danger by an eminent
physician&mdash;in fact, his Majesty's own medical attendant, who
had come from the Louvre to visit him.  Madame the
Countess was quite radiant with joy, as she dearly loved her
brother the wild chevalier, and was now awaiting me in her
boudoir.'
</p>

<p>
As I hastily swallowed my hot coffee from a silver cup and
salver, the figure of this remarkable woman seemed to rise
before me in fancy, with her dark voluptuous eyes, half veiled
by their long and drooping silky lashes, her delicate lips so
strangely red and full; her complexion of surpassing brilliance;
her luxuriant hair, her large, full, and stately form, with
hands and feet which, for one of her size, were wonderfully
and beautifully small.
</p>

<p>
And then her smile, unequalled in pretty roguery and
witchery!
</p>

<p>
I finished my coffee and sighed, I knew not why.
</p>

<p>
'Let me be wary,' thought I, 'or I shall really end by
loving this woman.'
</p>

<p>
Antoine, with considerable circumspection, conducted me
towards her boudoir or dressing-room, and raising a curtain,
ushered me at once and unannounced into her presence.  This
little apartment was charming.  It was nearly circular, being
in a tower of the château, and from a window I could see the
smoke of Paris and the two dark towers of Notre Dame in the
distance.  The walls were hung with pale-blue silk and
silver; the furniture was all tapestry, and inlaid with
mother-of-pearl.  The tables were buhl; the carpet Persian, and the
ceiling of blue, powdered with fleurs-de-lis, and painted in a
florid style, to suit the French taste of the age.  Nothing was
spared in the way of expense, and it was averred that, for the
fair inmate of the Château d'Amboise, the king, when his own
funds failed, gave her more than one order for a thousand
crowns of the sum, upon Messire Estein Janin, Seigneur de
Bertiliac (treasurer to her Majesty <i>the Queen Consort</i>), whose
office and residence were then in the Petit Bourbon.
</p>

<p>
A prie-dieu of oak, richly carved and covered with blue
velvet embroidered with silver, stood in the centre of the
apartment; on it lay a gilded missal; but both seemed as if
they were much less in use than the mirror, the fan, and the
curling-tongs on the toilette-table.
</p>

<p>
The Countess was seated before a mirror, with a fan of
feathers in her hand.  Her neck, arms, and perhaps rather
too much of her large, fair bosom, were bare; but their
whiteness was dazzling, and contrasted powerfully with the rich
deep tint of the soft and silky hair which fell in wavy masses
over her shoulders, and which the expert hands of her
tire-woman, a fair-haired creature, plainly dressed (in fact, my
pretty mask of the last night), were wreathing, curling, and
pinning up for the morning, previous to the visit of her
perruquier.
</p>

<p>
A brilliant young noble clad in white velvet laced with
broad bars of gold, and having a diamond star sparkling on
his left breast, was rising from his knee before her, as I
entered, and for an instant I was conscious of a pang of
jealousy.  His complexion was dark; his eyes keen; his
mouth beautifully cut, and his bearing was more than
courtly&mdash;it was full of natural grace.  The manner in which
madame smiled and held out her hand, reassured me.
</p>

<p>
'Welcome, M. Arthur,' said she; 'this conjuncture is
fortunate.  M. le Marquis, allow me to present to you the
young gentleman of whom we have just been speaking, ard
who is so warmly recommended to me by our friend
Monseigneur le Duc de Lennox.  M. Arthur, this gentleman is
Monseigneur le Marquis de Gordon, Commander of the
King's Scottish Guard.'
</p>

<p>
I bowed low on hearing this, and all momentary emotion
of pique gave way to the warmth of heart and cameraderie
with which Scotsmen always meet in a foreign land.  The
uniform of the marquis was white, as worn by the Scottish
guard 'in token of their unspotted fidelity and unstained
honour.'  The diamond badge on his left breast was the star
and cross of St. Andrew.
</p>

<p>
'A friend of my mother's house will always be welcome to
me,' said he, pressing my hand; 'for Henrietta Stewart made
some mixture in the blood of Lennox and Huntly, allying
them thus for ever.  I have just heard your story from the
Countess, and sympathize with you; it is the old tale of local
oppression and misgovernment, which will ever exist while
the affairs of Scotland are committed to the care of needy
lawyers and desperate placemen.  But our king will find it
perilous work to push his projects on the Scottish Church&mdash;of
that anon.  And so you wish to serve king Louis?'
</p>

<p>
'Yes, my Lord, in any military capacity that may become
a gentleman.  I have come to France to feed myself with the
sword that fed my father before me; for he, too, served in the
Scottish Guard.'
</p>

<p>
'True&mdash;at the siege of Rochelle, at Caumont, and the
capture of the Château de Sully; I have seen his name in our
records, which bear honourable testimony to his bravery and
worth.'
</p>

<p>
My heart swelled as the Marquis spoke.  This handsome
young noble was then in his thirtieth year.  George, Lord
Gordon, was styled marquis in France, being eldest son and
heir-apparent of that Marquis of Huntly, who was Lieutenant
of the North and commander of the insurgent Scottish
Catholics who defeated the king's troops at the battle of
Benrinnes.
</p>

<p>
'You have come at a fortunate time, sir.  A war with
Lorraine and the vaunting empire is now in every man's
mouth; and I shall be glad to rally round king Louis every
Scottish gentleman who may be useful to his cause.  His
ministers have already drawn up the plan of the campaign at
the Louvre.'
</p>

<p>
'Indeed, ma foi! they have lost no time,' said the
Countess, fanning herself vehemently.
</p>

<p>
'The frontiers of Lorraine and Alsace are all as well known
to us as the Boulevardes.'
</p>

<p>
The attendant of the Countess, who listened intently to all
that passed, trembled very perceptibly at these words, and I
could perceive that when the Countess glanced at her, she
blushed to the temples.
</p>

<p>
'When we unfurl the oriflamme beyond the Rhine,' resumed
the Marquis, clanking his steel spurs; 'ma foi! madame,
but we shall make the kettle-drums boil, ere we run short of
provant.'
</p>

<p>
A cloud crossed the beautiful face of Clara d'Amboise, but
a smile chased it away.
</p>

<p>
'You forget, Marquis,' said she, 'that my mother was a
lady of Lorraine; and to speak thus in my boudoir is merely
to imitate Rodomont in the old romance.  He was ever noisy
and furious.'
</p>

<p>
The Marquis laughed, showing teeth as white as her own
under a moustache as dark as her eyebrows; and he
replied,&mdash;
</p>

<p>
'Pardon me, madame; but while in your presence in
future, I shall be dumb on this subject, and every other you
dislike&mdash;ay! dumb as&mdash;'
</p>

<p>
'The old bell of Burgundy,' added Clara, laughing.
</p>

<p>
'Dumb as&mdash;what, madame?'

<p>
'The old bell which Clotaire II. carried away from the
church of Notre Dame de Soissons, that stood in a pleasant
valley by the banks of the Aisne.  The successors of Clovis
had made Soissons the seat of the empire, and as this old bell
had been rung there on a thousand joyful occasions, it resented
to such a degree its removal to Paris that it became dumb,
and all the bell-ringers in the city could not elicit a sound
from it.  "Diable!" said king Clotaire, "this bell shows
very bad taste, indeed, not to like our city of Paris."  So he
sent it back to its old belfry; and the moment it found itself
swinging securely in the ancient church of Notre Dame de
Soissons it rung for seven hours, though untouched by mortal
hand, and rung so loudly, too, as to be heard for seven miles
down the valley of the Aisne.'
</p>

<p>
'A marvellous story&mdash;but scarcely suited to the days of
Louis XIII.'
</p>

<p>
'Scarcely,' added the Countess; and as the last chesnut
braid of her magnificent hair was finished, she smiled gaily,
and said to her attendant, 'You, my dear Nicola, may leave
us now.'
</p>

<p>
The young girl made a low reverence, and with one of her
disdainful smiles lurking in her charming eyes and mouth
withdrew.
</p>

<p>
'Who is that girl?' asked the Marquis, with considerable
interest.
</p>

<p>
'My attendant,' replied the Countess briefly.
</p>

<p>
'So I perceive, madame; is she a Parisian?
</p>

<p>
'No&mdash;a provincial.'
</p>

<p>
'A provincial!'
</p>

<p>
'Why this surprise, M. le Marquis?'
</p>

<p>
'Her air is queenly.  I never saw hands more divinely
formed.  Her birth must be above her station.'
</p>

<p>
'Poor Nicola! she would be quite overwhelmed if she
heard you; it would turn the poor girl's head.  But,
Marquis, what of all this?'
</p>

<p>
'Merely that she is even worthy to be your attendant,'
replied the politic captain of cuirassiers, as he kissed the hand
of Clara.
</p>

<p>
'You are very inquisitive, Marquis,' said she, giving him a
pat on the mouth with her feather fan; 'I can assure you that
she is only a poor girl consigned to my care&mdash;the daughter of
a brave soldier who fought at the battle of Prague.'
</p>

<p>
'When our present enemy, the Duke of Lorraine,
commanded the Imperialists.'
</p>

<p>
'Lorraine?' murmured the Countess, with some confusion.
'Yes&mdash;he did command there.'
</p>

<p>
'And the cowardly Elector Guelph was defeated,' added
the Marquis, with a smile.
</p>

<p>
Madame d'Amboise gave him a furtive and uneasy glance,
and then turned away.  He gazed at her broadly in turn, with
a smile which said plainly.
</p>

<p>
'Here is a <i>secret&mdash;a mystery</i>, which I cannot fathom.'
</p>

<p>
To change the subject, she said, in her playful way,
</p>

<p>
'Were you ever really in love, Marquis?'
</p>

<p>
'Your invariable query&mdash;yes, often,' said Gordon, with a
smile.
</p>

<p>
'Indeed!'
</p>

<p>
'But never with more than one woman at a time, madame;
be assured that no one can love either a place, a woman, or
aught else very long&mdash;a gay woman least of all, perhaps.'
</p>

<p>
'Mon Dieu, Marquis, you become more and more French
every day.'
</p>

<p>
Gordon seemed to be still reflecting; but he turned suddenly
to me, and said,
</p>

<p>
'Mr. Blane, you are about six feet high I think.'
</p>

<p>
'I am only five feet ten inches, my Lord.'
</p>

<p>
'Bravo, you are just the height for a cuirassier of the guard,
and shall be one.  We require but two more to complete our
hundred men-at-arms; and I expect the Viscount Dundrennan
and Sir Quentin Home daily from Scotland.  You lodge&mdash;'
</p>

<p>
'With Maître Pierre Omelette, at the Golden Fleur-de-lis.'
</p>

<p>
'Ah&mdash;in the Rue d'Ecosse&mdash;the name attracted you to that
street I presume.'
</p>

<p>
'Yes, Marquis.'
</p>

<p>
He smiled and patted me kindly on the shoulder.
</p>

<p>
'On riding back to the Louvre, I shall mention your name
to Patrick Gordon our Marechal de Logis; he will make all
the necessary arrangements, after which, you will be a
chevalier of the Scottish guard&mdash;farewell; Madame la Comtesse
adieu; I hope to see you in Paris soon&mdash;we have not had much
of the sun there lately.'
</p>

<p>
'Antoine, show out M. le Marquis,' said she, giving
Gordon her beautiful hand to kiss.
</p>

<p>
'Harkee Blane,' he whispered, hurriedly as he passed us;
'you are in a fair way to fortune; but as a brother Scot and
friend of my kinsman, I may warn you that you stand upon a
precipice.  Already she deems you one of her lovers, and as
such will consider nothing too good for you for a time; but
BE WARY!  This chamber has occasionally led to the Bastille
or to the more dreadful oubliettes of the Louvre.  Farewell,'
he added, raising his voice; 'the price of a horse is about six
hundred crowns&mdash;but our Marechal de Logis will arrange
everything for you.  His apartments are at the Louvre, where
he occupies the very shrine of love and beauty.'
</p>

<p>
'How, Marquis?' asked madame.
</p>

<p>
'He has the apartments of the beautiful Diana de Poictiers&mdash;the
Duchess de Valentinois&mdash;whose spirit is said to haunt
them.'
</p>

<p>
He retired, and left me standing midway between the arras
and the chair of the Countess, irresolute, dreading what was
to follow, yet unwilling to retire, and confounded by the
mysterious tenor of his emphatic whisper, which at that moment
I could scarcely analyse.

<h3>
CHAPTER VI.
<br /><br />
MADAME OPENS THE TRENCHES.
</h3>

<p>
And for a minute I continued to loiter between the doorway
over which the gorgeous hangings of blue and silver had fallen,
and the chair in which sat the beautiful friend of king Louis,
playing coquettishly with her fan of feathers.
</p>

<p>
Happily for me, I lived in a time, and had before me a
career, wherein every brave and handsome fellow could attain
fortune and distinction, if he made the essay with a tolerably
plausible tongue and a sharp rapier&mdash;the tongue for the ladies;
the rapier for the foes of the standard he fought under.
Yet, while conscious of this, I stood irresolutely, playing with
the somewhat worn feather that drooped from my beaver hat&mdash;I
was now entirely alone with this brilliant, self-possessed
and confident favourite of the king.
</p>

<p>
'M. Arthur, come hither,' said she.
</p>

<p>
I bowed.
</p>

<p>
'Are you afraid that I shall eat you?'
</p>

<p>
I bowed again, and approached her chair.
</p>

<p>
'Have you nothing to say to me?' she asked, turning her
eyes full upon me.
</p>

<p>
'Ah, madame, what shall I say&mdash;how express myself!'
</p>

<p>
'You know how much I have to forgive you.'
</p>

<p>
'Do not speak of it, madame.  Your brother's narrow escape
from a death at my hand, makes me tremble, when I think
of it!'
</p>

<p>
'We will talk of that another time.  Mademoiselle Nicola
has told me how much he and his debauched companion were
to blame in molesting her.'
</p>

<p>
'True, Countess.'
</p>

<p>
'But they knew not who she was.'
</p>

<p>
'How, madame?
</p>

<p>
'That she was my attendant and not a grisette,' said the
Countess hastily.  'You have heard all that M. le Marquis
has so kindly promised.'
</p>

<p>
'Oh yes, yes; more than I deserve, be assured.'
</p>

<p>
'What, are you so very wicked?'
</p>

<p>
'I trust not; yet I dare not express all I feel.'
</p>

<p>
'Am I then so terrible, or have you lost your tongue or
your wits?' she asked with a waggish smile in her beautiful
and half-closed eyes, as she leant back in the soft fautueil.
</p>

<p>
'If Madame la Comtesse would&mdash;&mdash;'
</p>

<p>
'Would what? speak out, boy; what are you thinking of?'
</p>

<p>
'Would pardon me, and excuse this confusion; for my soul
is full of nothing but perplexity and admiration.'
</p>

<p>
Thus did the magic of this woman's beauty sway me against
my reason, while I despised her position in my heart&mdash;a heart,
moreover, that was not ungrateful.
</p>

<p>
She burst into a fit of merry laughter.
</p>

<p>
'Ma foi! my dear young friend, my Scottish provincial,
you will make your fortune if you only continue as you have
begun.  A year in the Scottish guard will make you a more
accomplished chevalier than the Marquis de Gordon himself!
Really, without knowing it, you already act like a finished
courtier.'
</p>

<p>
'I will study to improve this acting, and if madame will
only permit to kiss her hand&mdash;&mdash;'
</p>

<p>
'Tush, you silly boy, we are quite alone; your heart is full
of gratitude, and you would only kiss my hand.  What a
timid little child it is!'
</p>

<p>
I kissed her on the cheek, and felt her soft perfumed hair
sweep across my forehead, as, tremulous with delight and
emotion, I drew back, abashed by my own temerity, for I was
but a boy; and the warning of the kind Marquis tingled in
my ears and in my heart.
</p>

<p>
'Poor child; it looks quite frightened,' said the Countess,
smiling with the most provoking coolness.
</p>

<p>
'Madame, I have a king for my rival.'
</p>

<p>
'Take courage.'
</p>

<p>
'I have never lacked it.'
</p>

<p>
'He who loses heart, loses all, in a game of this kind at
least.  From this time we are allies, sworn friends; when you
visit me again, do not enter by the porte cochère, but by the
secret door at the back of the château, <i>remember</i>.'
</p>

<p>
At that moment I perceived the fair form of the Countess's
golden-haired attendant, standing close by the arras which she
had raised unbidden.  She must have seen some portion of the
last episode; for her fine eyes were fixed, I thought, somewhat
pityingly on me, and disdainfully on her mistress.  This little
provincial in her plain coif was delicately beautiful in face,
hands, and form; but eclipsed and overshadowed as she was
by the brilliance and vivacity of the demonstrative Countess, I
took but little notice of her then.
</p>

<p>
The moment she perceived Nicola, Madame d'Amboise
coloured, and said to me rather sharply,
</p>

<p>
'Farewell, M. Arthur; you must now keep your appointment
in Paris with M. le Marquis and the Marechal de Logis
of the Scottish Guard; and remember that when all is
arranged, I shall always be delighted to see you at the Château
d'Amboise.'  She rang a handbell, and Antoine appeared.
</p>

<p>
'Tell the master of the stables to give this gentleman my
bay horse Dagobert, which he will please to keep as a gift
from me.  Now go, M. Arthur; and by the haste with which
you return, I shall judge of your regard and your gratitude.
Adieu.'  In ten minutes more I was on the road to Paris.
</p>

<p>
I may briefly mention, that before leaving the château, I
was permitted, after innumerable difficulties, to visit my
antagonist of the preceding night.  I found him in bed, a
handsome and soldier-like fellow, but pale with loss of blood, and,
though out of danger, weak and severely wounded.  I begged
his forgiveness, which he readily accorded, and declined to
accept back his ring; but requested my word of honour, that
I would not mention his name to any one in Paris, as he
was an officer of the Duke of Lorraine&mdash;the chevalier Raoul
d'Ische, to have whom quietly disposed of, in one of the
oubliettes of the Louvre or the stone cages of Louis XI.,
Cardinal Richelieu would readily pay a thousand crowns of
the sun, for Raoul was the right arm of Lorraine.
</p>

<p>
'How, then, does the king's physician visit you?'
</p>

<p>
'Because his place depends upon the smile or frown of my
sister Clara.  The reason of the Cardinal's enmity to me and
to my master the Duke, on whose service I am secretly in
Paris, another month will explain; but the Cardinal dreads
us more than that cancer of which his mistress Anne of
Austria is dying,' said he, as he pressed my hand, and I left him.

<h3>
CHAPTER VII.
<br /><br />
CHARENTON.
</h3>

<p>
The horse I rode, my new bay horse Dagobert, was a beautiful
animal, and his housings were worthy of the generous
donor, whose strange freedom of manner and voluptuous
image, filled all my thoughts as I rode on; and heedless of
the way to Paris, caracoled along the green lanes and hedgerows,
until I lost the main road, and found myself at a village
beside a broad river.  It proved to be Charenton-on-the-Marne,
and about four miles from Paris.  I was about to ride
on, when my informant, who was an innkeeper, asked me to
tarry and refresh.
</p>

<p>
'There is an inn here?' said I.
</p>

<p>
'An inn?  I should think so! and there is no better in
France; 'tis my own, M. le Chevalier; an inn where Henri
Quatre himself has dined and got drunk, and where you may
still see his favourite oath, <i>Ventre Saint Gris</i>, written with his
diamond ring on a window.'
</p>

<p>
It was a quaint old tumble-down house, at the end of the
stone bridge, with pigeon-holes for windows, and covered up
to the chimney tops in luxuriant ivy and wild roses.  Without
dismounting, I drank a pot of wine under the sign-board,
which bore on one side three fleurs-de-lis, and on the other a
likeness of Henry the Great, with his famous white feather in
his helmet, waggishly on one side, just as he wore it at the
battle of Ivry.  This sign-board had been painted, for a pot
of wine and a loaf of bread, by a poor discharged soldier,
who was travelling to Paris; and this dusty wayfarer was now
known to honourable fame as Nicolas Poussin, of whom
Louis XIII. was proud to be the patron.
</p>

<p>
'And how came it to pass,' said I, 'that within four miles
of the Louvre, Henry the Great halted at an auberge so
humble as this?'
</p>

<p>
'It was all an accident, M. le Chevalier,' replied the host,
receiving my empty tankard with a profound bow.  'You
must know, that one day Henry IV. was hunting in yonder
wood, on the left bank of the Marne, and having outridden
all his company, and left even the twenty-four chosen
gentlemen of the Scottish guard far behind, he arrived here at
nightfall weary and travel-stained, with a lame horse and a
sharpened appetite.  Of the hostess he inquired if he could
have anything to eat.
</p>

<p>
'"Monsieur has come too late," said she, taking him for a
private gentleman, in his long black leather boots, and plain
jackwambeson.
</p>

<p>
'"Ventre Saint Gris!" muttered the King, in his strong
Bearnais accent; "and for whom is all this dainty roast,
which turns so savourily on your spit, madame?"
</p>

<p>
'"For eight gentlemen, who are upstairs."
</p>

<p>
'"Eight, who&mdash;madame?"
</p>

<p>
'"Gentlemen, whom I believe to be solicitors of Paris."
</p>

<p>
'"Then say to them, madame, if you please, that a gentleman,
a traveller who is weary, begs the honour of being
permitted to sit at the same board with messieurs the solicitors,
and that he will gladly pay for his share of the repast with a
good flask of wine to boot."
</p>

<p>
'The hostess duly delivered the message, but the solicitors
being low fellows, loudly and rudely declined.
</p>

<p>
'"No!" exclaimed they; "no, sang-dieu! not if your
traveller were Henry IV. himself!"
</p>

<p>
'"Ventre Saint Gris!" swore the King again, and,
drawing his sword, laid hold of the roasted meat.
</p>

<p>
'At that moment a chevalier of the Scottish Guard appeared,
having discovered the inn quite by accident, and the
profound salute he accorded to her visitor surprised and
terrified the landlady.
</p>

<p>
'"Sieur Blane," said the King&mdash;'
</p>

<p>
'<i>Blane!</i>' I reiterated; 'oh, heavens! this Scottish guardsman
was <i>my father</i>!'  But, heedless of me, the garrulous
Frenchman, full of his story, continued:
</p>

<p>
'"Sieur Blane," said the Bearnais, "I am likely to be
starved in this devil of an inn, for there are up stairs eight
solicitors of our city of Paris, who have seized all the
provisions, and will not permit me to eat with them!"
</p>

<p>
'The Sieur Blane drew his sword, and, curling up his long
mustachios, swore he would put every man of them to death;
but at that moment in came the Sieur de Vitry, with ten more
gentlemen of the Scottish Guard: so to teach messieurs the
solicitors politeness for the future, they were all seized and
sent to Grosbois, where they were well whipped with a bridle-rein,
their threats, entreaties, and remonstrances only exciting
laughter in the Sieur Blane and his comrades.  Hence,
monsieur, my inn bears the head of the brave Bearnais&mdash;king
Henry IV.'
</p>

<p>
I thanked the landlord, slipped a coin into his hand, and
after gazing with more than ordinary attention at this quaint
old auberge, where, more than thirty years ago, my brave
father had this remarkable adventure with 'the arbiter of
Christendom,' I left Charenton, and turned the head of
Dagobert towards Paris; but I was so much delighted with
the paces, speed, and beauty of the fine animal, that I
caracoled round the boulevardes, and noon was long passed
before I entered by the ancient gate of St. Marcel.
</p>

<p>
My heart was full of exultation and gratitude.
</p>

<p>
'Fortune, what have I done, that thou shouldest favour me
thus?' I exclaimed, while prancing along, thinking of the
beauty of Clara d'Amboise, the too evident favour with
which she viewed me, and the brilliant prospect she had
opened before me, by an honourable career in the Scottish
Guard&mdash;the oldest and most noble body of men-at-arms the
world ever saw; but on the cornice of the gate of St. Marcel
I perceived a skull, bare, white, and bleached.  This gave my
thoughts an unpleasant turn, and the warnings of the Marquis
recurred to my memory.
</p>

<p>
On inquiry, I was informed that this poor remnant of
humanity was the head of Guy de Beaumanoir, Baron de
Fontenelle, who had been accused many years ago of a design
to deliver up the fortress of Dournenes to the Spaniards, for
which he was dragged to the Place de la Grève, and
barbarously broken alive on the wheel.
</p>

<p>
I rode through the heart of the city, crossed the Place
Maubert and the Pont de Notre Dame, and proceeded along
the crowded quays, where every variety of signboard,
indicative of trade and traffic, with barbers' glittering basins,
were swinging in the wind, and where many a veiled figure of
Mary Queen of Scots&mdash;la Heine Blanche&mdash;the invariable sign
of a French milliner, was displayed; and thence along the
quaint Rue St. Germain l'Auxerrois, at the end of which I
perceived the pointed turrets, the narrow windows, and
guarded drawbridge of the palace of Francis I.&mdash;the Louvre&mdash;which
I, who had never seen a statelier building than the
barred and moated towers of our Scottish barons, conceived to
be the grandest edifice in the world.
</p>

<p><br /><br /><br /></p>

<p><a id="chap08"></a></p>

<h3>
CHAPTER VIII.
<br /><br />
THE MARECHAL DE LOGIS.
</h3>

<p>
A soldier of the Grey Musketeers, who was on duty at one
of the gates, politely directed me to the quarters of Patrick
Gordon, the Marechal de Logis of the Garde du Corps
Ecossais.
</p>

<p>
He proved to be a hale and handsome old man, a cadet of
the house of Lochinvar; his beard and mustachios were
almost white, and his complexion was very dark; a sword-cut,
the badge of some battle-field&mdash;a badge which he valued more
than his crosses of St. Lazare and Mont Carmel&mdash;traversed
his right cheek by a long and ghastly line.  His costume was
somewhat of the Spanish fashion, being brown velvet laced
with silver; he had a high ruff, and long buff boots, with gold
spurs.  A white-satin scarf sustained his steel-hilted rapier,
into the bowl of which he usually stuffed his laced handkerchief.
I announced myself, and all further explanations were
cut short, by his saying&mdash;
</p>

<p>
'Welcome, M. Blane, to France, and to the Louvre!  I
expected you, for the Marquis, who has just left me, mentioned
that you were to join us.  You shall be at once enrolled
in the cuirassiers of the Guard, with those two gentlemen, who
have just arrived in Paris, this morning, from Scotland.'
</p>

<p>
Two gentlemen richly dressed, each with a pair of pistols
in his girdle, who were in the recess of a window, where they
had been observing a regiment of light horse passing along
the Rue St. Germain l'Auxerrois, now came forward, and the
Marechal de Logis at once introduced us all.
</p>

<p>
One who was tall and fair, with a long mustache, his hair
cut short, and a stern expression of eye, and who wore a white
satin pourpoint, with gloves and boots of pink perfumed
leather, proved to be Richard Maxwell, Viscount of
Dundrennan.  His grandfather, the cunning old commendator,
having had influence enough to get the abbey-lands of
Dundrennan erected into a temporal lordship, as the reward of
certain doubtful services performed under the Regent Mar,
who was poisoned by the Regent Morton.
</p>

<p>
The other, who was a dark man, with aquiline features, a
square forehead, a black, expressive eye, and a perpetual
smile, was Sir Quentin Home of Ravendean, one of the new
baronets of Nova Scotia, usually known at home as the Laird
of Redden.  Both were young, handsome, and brave gallants,
being free, jovial, and soldierly in manner.
</p>

<p>
'How came you to Paris, Blanerne?' asked the Viscount,
who was the only Maxwell that was not against me in the
feud with Nithsdale.
</p>

<p>
'By the way of Havre, my Lord.'
</p>

<p>
'Sir Quentin and I came by the way of London, for we had
both to cross the borders with greater speed than was quite to
our taste.'
</p>

<p>
'How so, sirs?' asked the Marechal de Logis, looking up
from the muster-roll.
</p>

<p>
Lord Dundrennan coloured, but did not reply.
</p>

<p>
'You must know, sir,' said the Laird of Redden, 'that
our friend the Viscount, to the great scandal of the kirk session
and whole community of Dundrennan, conceived a vehement
regard for the buxom wife of the abbey miller; and, with a
dozen of Maxwells, all armed to the teeth, in back, breast,
and pot, with partizan and pistol, he laid siege to the mill one
night, when the moon was yet below the waves of the Solway.
The dame, nothing loth, sprang into his arms from a
back-window; but her devil of a husband, who resented this
exceedingly, after permitting himself to bawl in a most unseemly
manner, had recourse to an arquebuse, and from an eyelet-hole
shot one of the Viscount's men through the jaws.  A general
riot ensued, and somehow, in the confusion, the mill was
burned, and the poor miller was found drowned in his dam.
My lord of Kirkcudbright, the steward of the stewartry,
raised his vassals to punish these proceedings; and to avoid
the Commissioners of Justiciary, my friend mounted a horse
one night, crossed the borders, and went to London.  There
he met me in the Scots' Walk one day, looking out for a
passage hither, for I too had become involved in an unpleasant
scrape.'
</p>

<p>
'And had to leave Scotland hastily?'
</p>

<p>
'Yes, Marechal de Logis&mdash;it happened thus.  One night,
when riding near Berwick Bounds, with a few of my friends
and kinsmen, all well horsed and armed with jack and spear,
we found a herd of fine fat cattle grazing on the Debatable
Land; and mistaking them for our own, we very naturally
drove them homeward at a smart trot, ever and anon striking
them with the flat of our swords, or administering a goad with
the lance.  Instead of being ours, however, they proved to
be, unfortunately, the property of the English Governor of
Berwick, who sent after us a party of horse, commanded by
one of the King's captains.  Now everybody knows that
English troops dare not enter Scotland without violating the
rights of the nation; thus a conflict ensued&mdash;the captain was a
very troublesome fellow, so I ran him through the body; but
we were defeated, and the cattle retaken.  The English
Governor complained to Sir Archibald Acheson, of Glencairn,
the Secretary of State for Scotland, and warrants were
issued against me; so one evening I marched off without beat
of drum; but being without a passport, was taken at Carlisle,
and sent back to Scotland.  Our Secretary was disposed
to be vindictive, and placed me in the castle of Lochmaben,
charged with riot and felony; but my keeper, the Javellour,
fell and broke his arm one day, while speaking to me; so I
took care not to miss the opportunity, and wrenching away his
keys, locked him up in my place.  I then left the castle, and
taking with me the best horse I could find, rode to Dumfries,
where I sold my nag and a valuable ring, got shipping for
England, and reached London with a few crowns in my
pouch, bent on seeking foreign service.  At the King's Head,
in Southwark, I lived with the Viscount Dundrennan, who
was on the same errand.  The Rye carrier furnished us with
saddle-horses, at twelve shillings a man.  We reached Rye,
one of the Cinque Ports, about sixty miles from the English
capital, and put up at the Mermaid, outside the ramparts.
The bully host was saucy to us, because we were Scots&mdash;so
I stuffed his wig down his throat, while the Viscount flung all
the furniture out of the windows.  The churlish townsmen
betook them to staves and bills; but we fought our way to a
French lugger&mdash;one of those craft that are generally engaged
in the conveyance of chalk from the cliffs near the East
Bourne&mdash;and got clear off, with a few bruises.  Landing at
Dieppe, we lodged at the house of an Englishman, near the
church of St. James.  On the very day we arrived, I became,
embroiled in an affair of honour.  On the ramparts, which are
the public promenade, a gentleman jostled me somewhat
rudely, and passed on; but I twitched the end of his mantle,
saying,
</p>

<p>
'"Monsieur will, of course, apologise?"
</p>

<p>
'"That, I think should rather be your task," said he.
</p>

<p>
'"A task it would be&mdash;but it shall be my pleasure to teach
you politeness; follow me."
</p>

<p>
'We reached a retired place near the old castle of
Dieppe&mdash;threw our hats and cloaks on the ground, and drew our
rapiers.
</p>

<p>
'"You have challenged me," said my antagonist; "I
therefore have the right of weapons."
</p>

<p>
'"Agreed," said I.
</p>

<p>
'"Your name, Monsieur?" said he; "I always like to know
the names of those I kill."
</p>

<p>
'"Sir Quentin Home, a Baronet of Scotland&mdash;yours?"
</p>

<p>
'"M. le Comte de Forgatz&mdash;&mdash;"'
</p>

<p>
'Good Heavens!' exclaimed the Marechal de Logis; 'he
is the greatest duellist and most deadly shot in France.  It is
a miracle that you are alive!'
</p>

<p>
Sir Quentin smiled with careless disdain.
</p>

<p>
'We tossed up for the first fire and it fell to the Count.
He fired, and the ball grazed my right ear&mdash;.'
</p>

<p>
'The devil! that was a close shave.'
</p>

<p>
'"Now, M. le Comte," said I, "'tis my turn&mdash;up with
your right hand."
</p>

<p>
'He delayed.
</p>

<p>
'"Up with it, or by the soul of St. Andrew, I will shoot you
through the heart!"
</p>

<p>
'He held it up, and in an instant my bullet whistled right
through the palm of it.
</p>

<p>
'"A thousand curses!" he exclaimed, in a voice hoarse with
rage and pain, as he dashed his pistol at my head; but I
forced him to apologise for daring to jostle me, and so the
affair ended.'
</p>

<p>
'Bravo!' said the old Marechal de Logis; '<i>Fier comme un
Ecossais!</i> as the French have it.'
</p>

<p>
'After this camisado, we hired horses, and at Rouen swam
them through the river Seine in sheer bravado, because the
bridge of boats had been swept away.  At Santeville, the
Viscount fought a duel in defence of a grisette, and disarmed
his antagonist, a gigantic officer of Swiss, at the third pass;
and so, without further adventure, we reached Paris this
morning.  These are our adventures; and now Mr. Blane
for yours.'
</p>

<p>
I soon related mine at least, all with which I deemed it
prudent to acquaint two such hare-brained youths as my new
comrades.
</p>

<p>
'Now, my Lord Dundrennan and gentlemen, you are
fairly enrolled as members of king Louis' Ancient Scottish
Guard,' said the Marshal de Logis; 'be pleased to sign your
names here, after the usual oaths of allegiance and fidelity to
his most Christian Majesty, which are all in accordance with
those acts of the Scottish Parliament, by which the subjects of
France and Scotland are naturalised each in the country of
the other.  Then we shall adjourn to the Fleur-de-lis, where
you must all dine with me.  I will bring two or three other
gentlemen of the corps, and we will have all your news about
poor old Scotland, the king and kirk, over a few bottles of
prime burgundy.'
</p>

<p>
'Thanks, Marechal de Logis,' said the Viscount.
</p>

<p>
'With pleasure,' said I; and after Patrick Gordon had
bundled away his documents, we took our swords and cloaks,
and sallied forth.
</p>

<p>
Gordon showed us the new buildings which were in course
of erection in the Place Dauphine, and the Bridge Marchand,
which had been built a few years before in place of the
picturesque Pont aux Meuniers, by Charles le Marchand,
captain of the arquebussiers and archers of Paris in 1608, who
undertook, with permission of Henry IV., to erect the said
bridge, on condition that it should bear his name.  Close by
were the ruins of the ancient Pont aux Meuniers which had
a mill under every arch, and which broke down on the night
of the 22nd December, 1596, destroying five hundred persons,
every one of whom, as the Marechal de Logis informed us, had
enriched themselves by the massacre of St. Bartholomew.
Here, too, stood the pigeon market, whence the bridge was
named at times the Pont aux Colombes.
</p>

<p>
'Oho, chevalier,' said Gordon, to a gay gentleman clad in
cloth of gold, with a red feather in his hat, who was bidding
adieu to a pretty woman, who seemed to be the wife of a
bourgeois; 'I see they still sell pigeons on the Pont aux
Colombes?'
</p>

<p>
'Occasionally, Patrick, and game of other kinds, too,' said
he, saluting us with a merry smile.
</p>

<p>
'We are all going to dine at the Fleur-de-lis.  Will you
join us?'
</p>

<p>
'With pleasure.'
</p>

<p>
''Tis one of ourselves, gentlemen,' continued the frank old
Marechal de Logis; 'allow me to introduce the Chevalier
Livingstone, one of the bravest gallants in the Scottish Guard;
Viscount Dundrennan, Sir Quentin Home, and the Laird of
Blanerne, have all come, chevalier, from our dear auld mither
Scotland, to fight for king Louis of France.'
</p>

<p>
We all bowed and shook hands.
</p>

<p>
The Chevalier Livingstone was the younger son of Henry
Count of Angoulême, who was the son of Henry II., by a
daughter of the Scottish house of Linlithgow, and in right
of his grandmother's blood was admitted into the Scottish
Guard.
</p>

<p>
As we rambled towards the Rue d'Ecosse, we passed the
magnificent house of the famous courtesan Marion de
l'Orme, which by chance had a company of the Cardinal's
musketeers drawn up before it.  This occasioned a hundred
irreverend jokes from the chevalier and the lively old Marechal
de Logis; and here another handsome cavalier of the Scottish
Guard, Raynold Cheyne, of Dundargle in Fifeshire, joined us.
His doublet was of black velvet, so thickly ornamented with
jet that it glittered like a corslet in the sun.  His mantle was
dark crimson; his long boots were of black leather; his sword
and dagger hilts of silver, and altogether he was a sombre,
picturesque, and impressive-looking fellow.
</p>

<p>
I saw the statue of Henry the Great as we passed along the
Rue St. Honoré, and in that quaint old street the Feronnerie,
Cheyne showed me the exact spot where, twenty-three years
before, Henry had perished under the dagger of Ravaillac,
beneath the windows of a notary named Pontrain, at a place
where the street was crowded and rendered more narrow by
the little shops which are built against the walls of the
churchyard of St. Innocent.
</p>

<p>
'Hah!' said the old Marechal de Logis, with a grin, 'had
our Scottish Guard been with Henry in lieu of his wretched
French lacqueys, Ravaillac had never achieved the dreadful
deed of that day!'
</p>

<p>
'And where were they?' asked the Viscount.
</p>

<p>
'They were marching towards the frontier, as a war was
expected with Spain,' replied our veteran comrade, as we
found ourselves in the Rue d'Ecosse, and at the sign of the
Golden Fleur-de-lis, kept by Maître Pierre Omelette.
</p>

<h3>
CHAPTER IX.
<br /><br />
WE DINE AT THE FLEUR-DE-LIS.
</h3>

<p>
This hotel was a picturesque old mansion having three sharp
wooden gables that cut the blue sky overhead, and projected
over the street on beams of grotesquely-carved wood, which
rested on stone pillars, like some of the old timber-fronted
houses of king James IV.'s time which I had seen at home.
A large sign-board bearing a blue shield powdered with
golden fleurs-de-lis swung on a rusty iron rod above the
thoroughfare.
</p>

<p>
The arrival of six cavaliers all so showily attired&mdash;five of
them at least being so&mdash;with plume and mantle, sword and
dagger, and having, moreover, in their hats the white silver
cross of St. Andrew, which in Paris was the distinguishing
badge of that patrician band the Guard du Corps Ecossais,
made the host bow at least eighteen successive times to the
red rosettes of his garters as he ushered us into a
plainly-furnished room, decorated by a few coarse Flemish engravings
of the wars in Flanders&mdash;the siege of the Brielle and the
fighting at the Isle Rhé.  There were also two tawdry prints
of the beautiful Ninon de l'Enclos, which the Chevalier
Livingstone and Raynold Cheyne pronounced to be execrable
likenesses, and proposed to tear down.
</p>

<p>
My friends being all gay fellows entered as noisily as a
herd of scholars broken loose from school&mdash;all jokes and
laughter&mdash;for in Paris all seemed to live as if their lives
and joys were to last for ever, like those of the gods in
Homer.
</p>

<p>
'By the devil's mercy, M. Fleur-de-lis, my brave bully
host,' said the Marechal de Logis, 'but thy wife looks well
and rosy!'
</p>

<p>
'As if she were a widow,' added the Chevalier Livingstone,
pinching her chin.
</p>

<p>
'Dinner for six, Madame Omelette&mdash;and plenty of Burgundy&mdash;'
</p>

<p>
'Nay Marechal, devil strangle me, no Burgundy for me&mdash;but
Champagne&mdash;the pure wine of Champagne,' said Cheyne
of Dundargle, who had lost his left ear under Lord Teviot
at the capture of Nanci in 1633.
</p>

<p>
'Champagne and Burgundy be it&mdash;M. le Duc de Burgundy's
best, by Jupiter!' said the Viscount.
</p>

<p>
'To the devil with Jupiter and all false gods,' cried Sir
Quentin, adding his voice to the din; 'let us all shout Vive
le Roi!'
</p>

<p>
''Tis all the French thou hast learned yet.'
</p>

<p>
''Tis enough for me, Viscount.'
</p>

<p>
'And will serve thee under fire,' said the Marechal de
Logis; 'but make love to a grisette, and she will soon teach
you French.'
</p>

<p>
'Thanks for the advice, sir.  I have already engaged a
preceptress.'
</p>

<p>
'What! you who have not been twenty-four hours in Paris?'
</p>

<p>
'Yes, I.  The language of the eyes will aid the language
of the tongue.'
</p>

<p>
'Of course, Viscount,' said the Chevalier Livingstone.
'Noel!  Noel! say I, like Messieurs le Bourgeois, whenever
they are pleased, and choose to quote the canticle.'
</p>

<p>
'Aha, chevalier! where do they cry this?'
</p>

<p>
'At the Petit Theatre, where the old scriptural moralities
are acted by women quite nude.  Yes, sirs.  Zounds!  Viscount
Dundrennan, what would your sobersided kirk session say to
that?'
</p>

<p>
'And to buying pigeons in daylight at the Pont aux
Colombes?' added Dundrennan, laughing.
</p>

<p>
'Seats, gentlemen,' said Pierre Omelette, the host, 'for
dinner waits.'
</p>

<p>
'Thank Heaven!' exclaimed the Chevalier, 'for I am alike
tired and hungry.  This forenoon I have fenced with the
King's master; drank with Chavagnac; chatted with Richelieu;
flirted with Marion in his absence; lost fifty crowns at
primero with the Duchesse de Bouillon; I have heard <i>le
Fête d'Amour</i> sung at the Opera in the Tennis Court de
Bellair; I tried a new horse for Mademoiselle Chevreuse
quite round the Boulevardes, and I am here!'
</p>

<p>
The dinner ordered by our old Marechal de Logis was
sumptuous; but I cannot say that I enjoyed it much; everything
was cooked in the French fashion; thus, fish, flesh, and
fowl were so disguised that I never knew of which I was
partaking.  The wines were excellent, and amid merriment
and anecdotes, the evening slipped joyously away.
</p>

<p>
The brusque air, the soldierly gaiety and jollity of these
brave spirits proved very infectious and captivating.  My
heart expanded with pleasure at the conviction that I was one
of them; and I longed&mdash;a poor ambition, perhaps&mdash;to emulate
them in their career of hare-brained frolics, duels, flirtations,
and intrigues.  As yet I felt myself but a boy; while they
were men, who treated me as an equal, and though not many
years my senior, Cheyne and the Chevalier were veritable
patriarchs in experience and knowledge of the world&mdash;the
wicked world of Paris.
</p>

<p>
The quarrels of our King and Kirk and all the Scottish
news&mdash;the cloud that overhung our government and the
threatened war with England&mdash;were soon discussed, for we
were sure that these disputes would come to the musket at
last.  Then we spoke of everything on the tapis; the cruel
burning of Madame la Marechale d'Ancre for witchcraft; the
alleged beauty of Marie Louise of Lorraine, who was said to be
secretly and politically intriguing in Paris; of the projected
war against her father the Duke; of duels and of girls; of
Cardinal Richelieu's state craft and profound cunning; of the
last new poem by Corneille, and the latest work of Poussin,
who, from being a poor disbanded soldier in the regiment of
Tavannes in which he served during the wars of Charles
IX. and Henry IV., had become the equal of Raphael; of the
beauty of the Countess d'Amboise (my heart leaped at her
name), the last mistress of the king, and she was declared to be
superior in loveliness even to the younger and lovely Marion
de l'Orme.
</p>

<p>
Every liaison in and about the Court was freely discussed.
The names of countesses and courtezans, grisettes and grandees
were all jangled together pell mell by these reckless fellows.
The intrigues of the Coadjutor; of Mademoiselle de Chevreuse;
of the beautiful Duchesse de Montbazon and the Duc de Beaufort,
were all canvassed as freely as if they had been the love-affairs
of students or musketeers, with grisettes and flower-girls.
All this seemed wonderfully easy, free, and, to me, not a little
brilliant and captivating; for I was barely twenty years of
age.
</p>

<p>
Some of their anecdotes and adventures were very remarkable.
</p>

<p>
Raynold Cheyne, of Dundargle, when quite a youth had
served as a cuirassier, under the famous Raymond, Count de
Montecuculi, in after years the rival of the great Turenne.
Once, when on the march through Germany, the Count had
given orders that, on pain of death, no soldier or cavalier
under his command, should tread down ripened corn.  A
soldier who rode a wild and unmanageable horse, spurred it
recklessly through a field of yellow grain near Leipzig; and
then Montecuculi ordered the Provost-Marshal to hang him
without ceremony at the first halting-place; but the soldier
advanced to Count Raymond and resolutely pleaded his
innocence, laying the whole blame upon his horse.
</p>

<p>
'Silence, sir!' said the Count, haughtily; 'the
Provost-Marshal shall do his duty.  Away with him!'
</p>

<p>
'Count Raymond,' exclaimed the cuirassier, full of rage and
vengeance, 'I was guiltless before; but shall no longer be so!'
and levelling his arquebuse, before he could be disarmed, he
fired a bullet through his colonel's plume.
</p>

<p>
'Thou art a brave fellow!' said the Count, with a sudden
admiration of his heedless daring; 'I pardon thee&mdash;give me
thy hand; and, in the charge to-morrow, let us see who will
go furthest among the Swedish ranks&mdash;thou or I.'
</p>

<p>
Next day was fought the great battle of Leipzig; where the
furious ardour of the Count de Montecuculi carried him so far
among the ranks of the victorious Swedes, that he was taken
prisoner.  One soldier, who attempted to rescue him, was also
taken.  He was the hero of the cornfield adventure&mdash;Raynold
Cheyne, of Dundargle&mdash;who thereafter left the Imperial
service and joined the Scottish Guard.
</p>

<p>
'Have you seen the house that the Comte de Treville,
captain of the Musketeers, has built for Ninon de l'Enclos?'
asked the Marechal de Logis, after the foregoing anecdote.
</p>

<p>
'Ninon,' murmured, the chevalier; 'the beautiful Ninon&mdash;no.'
</p>

<p>
''Tis quite a Palais Royale!' said Cheyne.
</p>

<p>
'How&mdash;has he left Marion de l'Orme?'
</p>

<p>
'No&mdash;for she still visits him at night, disguised as a page.
So M. de Bouillon told me.'
</p>

<p>
'Oho&mdash;just as she visits Richelieu.'
</p>

<p>
'She looked charming as she passed the cabaret where we
dined yesterday, chevalier.'
</p>

<p>
'Yes, Marechal, attended by Rouville, who fought the duel
about her with La Ferte Senecterre, exchanging five pretty
sword-thrusts and two pistol-shots.'
</p>

<p>
'She has a divine hand!'
</p>

<p>
'And magnificent bust.'
</p>

<p>
'But she spoils it,' said Livingstone, 'by those hideous
stays that are now in fashion.'
</p>

<p>
'Ah&mdash;that devilish invention of the queen of M. Henri le
Grand,' said the Marechal de Logis, for, in phraseology and
tastes, those Gardes Ecossais had become quite French.
</p>

<p>
'Still, she is not comparable to Madame d'Amboise,'
observed Cheyne.
</p>

<p>
'If we go to war with Duke Charles,' said the Viscount,
'what will the King do with his beautiful Lorrainer?'
</p>

<p>
'Send her to keep company with La Fayette in her
convent perhaps.'
</p>

<p>
'Her brother Raoul d'Ische commands a fortress in Alsace,'
said Gordon; 'but is it true that the Marquis our captain has
quite relinquished Marion de l'Orme?'
</p>

<p>
'Always that woman,' said the chevalier, laughing; ''pon
my soul, Marechal, I begin to think you are in love with her
yourself.'
</p>

<p>
'Having a fortune to spend&mdash;my poor pay as Marechal de
Logis of horse.'
</p>

<p>
'No&mdash;the Marquis has only been playing a game of three
points.  In love with Mademoiselle de Chevreuse, with the
Duchesse de Bouillon and with Marion.'
</p>

<p>
'So if he loses one point, two still remain.'
</p>

<p>
'But the blue-eyed Chevreuse is said to view with
favour our brave countryman the Lord Teviot, a colonel of
pikes.'
</p>

<p>
'Then she must find a successor,' said Gordon, 'for my
Lord Teviot was yesterday committed to the Bastille for
slaying a Chevalier of St. Lazare in a duel.'
</p>

<p>
'To the Bastille!'
</p>

<p>
'To the Bastille&mdash;for a duel!' we all exclaimed, indignantly.
</p>

<p>
'Yes&mdash;but it was fought within the precincts of the Palais
Royale.'
</p>

<p>
'Zounds!' said Raynold Cheyne, twisting his fierce moustache,
'in the days of Henry the Great, we might have fought
in his bed-chamber, and I am sure the brave Bearnais would
have enjoyed the sport.'
</p>

<p>
'And what was the duel about?' I asked.
</p>

<p>
'Oh! the old story&mdash;a girl&mdash;a fleuriste on the Pont de Notre
Dame.'
</p>

<p>
'And the chevalier was killed?'
</p>

<p>
'Run right through the body,' replied Gordon; 'and the
Cardinal, at the instance of Marion, whose lover M. le Chevalier
had formerly been, sent his Lordship to the Bastille.'
</p>

<p>
'Too bad this!' exclaimed the Viscount; 'my Lord Teviot
could not help this sprig of a chevalier not being immortal.
But why has a Cardinal all this power?'
</p>

<p>
'Because he is a minister, and since the days of Henry
IV. France has always been governed by ministers or&mdash;their
mistresses.'
</p>

<p>
Sir Quentin Home whose circumstances had been somewhat
desperate since he killed the English captain at Berwick,
now proposed cards.
</p>

<p>
'Let us play, gentlemen,' said he; 'Blane, we will draw
lots for partners.'
</p>

<p>
'Nay, Sir Quentin,' said I; 'I beg to be excused, having
only ten louis.'
</p>

<p>
'The devil thou hast?  I have only two in the world.'
</p>

<p>
'Then, why play?'
</p>

<p>
'For that very reason,' said he.
</p>

<p>
'But you may lose.'
</p>

<p>
'But I may win.'
</p>

<p>
'Thank you&mdash;but I would rather be excused.'
</p>

<p>
Sir Quentin frowned and pushed aside his glass.
</p>

<p>
'Never mind, Ravendean,' said the jolly Marechal de Logis;
'all the world are going to fight the Emperor and the Duke
of Lorraine; and we shall have rare pickings and plenty of
prize-money, when we march through Alsace and bend
our cannon on the Rhine.  Long ere that day comes to pass,
Sir Quentin, thy two louis may have become twenty thousand.
Now, gentlemen, a glass of right Rhenish all round, and then
M-e shall adjourn to the Comedie Française, and see all those
beauties we have been talking about&mdash;yes, see them in all the
bloom of beauty, rouge and patches, brocade and cloth of
gold.'
</p>

<p>
From the Fleur-de-lis we went after dusk to the Hotel de
Bourgogne, where plays had been acted since 1548, and where
we saw a tragedy by Scuderi, about heaven knows what, but
every one was killed in the last scene, to the entire satisfaction
of the audience.  After a petty brawl with the watch, and
singing a chorus under the windows of Marion de l'Orme, we
all repaired to our quarters in the Louvre.
</p>

<p>
And thus, at midnight, closed the first day I spent with my
wild and fiery comrades of the Garde du Corps Ecossais.

<h3>
CHAPTER X.
<br /><br />
THE SCOTS IN FRANCE.
</h3>

<p>
I was now fairly one of the hundred cuirassiers of that
Scottish Guard, whose name is inseparably connected with the
ancient royalty and military history of France, and who
formed the right hand of her kings in many a day of battle.
</p>

<p>
My horse, Dagobert, the gift of the Countess d'Amboise,
was a fine Spanish barb, worth at least seven hundred crowns
of the sun.  My arms and armour, supplied from the royal
arsenal, were similar to those worn by my comrades, and
consisted of a pale buff coat so thickly laced with silver as to
be almost sword-proof; a triple-barred helmet, with back and
breast-plates, gorget and gloves of the finest and purest steel,
inlaid with gold; an arquebuse, two feet and a half long,
attached to a belt by a swivel.  The pair of pistols, the dagger,
and long bowl-hilted Toledo rapier were my own.
</p>

<p>
Our plumes were white and blue, (the Scottish colours),
our scarfs and hocquetons, worn when attending the king at
mass or near his throne, were also white, trimmed with blue
and silver, in token of the pure fidelity which for centuries had
characterised the gentlemen of the Garde du Corps Ecossais.
</p>

<p>
My apartments in the Louvre were neatly but plainly
furnished by the valet de chambre de tapissier, or king's
upholsterer, Jean Baptiste Poquelin, in whose shop was his
son, a sharp little lad of fourteen years, who carried parcels
and messages.  Who could then have foreseen that <i>this little lad</i>,
who bore one's love letters and bouquets for a denier, or called
a fiacre from the stand at the street corner, would become in
after years the great Molière, the author of '<i>L'Etourdi</i>' and
'<i>Le Dépit Amoureux</i>'?
</p>

<p>
And now will the reader pardon the honest vanity&mdash;the
esprit du corps&mdash;of a soldier, when writing of his colours&mdash;of
his regiment, if I devote a few lines to the previous history of
the Scottish Guard?
</p>

<p>
The French annals inform us, that in virtue of the ancient
league between Achaius, King of Scotland and Charlemagne,
the latter first had a Scottish guard, and in return for the
compliment, Achaius first fenced the Scottish Lion with the
Fleur-de-lis, which we may still perceive in the royal standard.
</p>

<p>
Be the story or origin of this league what it may, there can
be no doubt that Charles of France, in the year 882, had an
armed guard of twenty-four Scotsmen, whom he preferred to
his own people, and whose ponderous battle-axes did him good
service in the wars he made to fence the See of Rome against
the Grecian Emperors; and old historians say, that he first
conceived the idea of having this guard by the advice of his
old preceptor, a wandering Kuldee, whom some name Alcuin
the Scot, and others Joannes Mailosius&mdash;or John of Melrose.
</p>

<p>
At Damietta, in the holy war, the life of St. Louis IX was
twice saved by a Scottish band, led by the knights Stewart,
Cumming, and Gordon; and in 1254, on his return from
Palestine, the king increased the number of this guard to a
hundred gentlemen-at-arms, and Charles V. afterwards placed
them on the regular establishment.*

<p>
In 1415, when brave Harry of England won the field of
Agincourt, and was acknowledged heir of France by the
ignoble Charles VI., the Scottish Guard, led by Robert
Patulloch, a native of Dundee, abandoned him, and marching
from Paris towards Gascony, joined the gallant Dauphin, to
whose assistance came several thousand veteran Scottish
infantry, led by John, Earl of Buchan, who gained the battle
of Bauge, on the 22nd March, 1421, cutting the English to
pieces and slaying the Duke of Clarence, whose coronet was
torn from his helmet by the Laird of Dalswinton.  It was a
desperate battle and a bloody one, as we might well expect
when Englishmen and Scot met hand to hand on a foreign
shore; and on that day the Dauphin, thenceforward Charles
VII., ordered the Guard to consist of a hundred Scots men-at-arms
and a hundred archers, to be commanded by the Earl of
Buchan, whom he made Great Constable of France.
</p>

<p>
Signalising themselves on a thousand occasions, this chosen
band of Scottish gentlemen were foremost at the storming of
Avranches, in Normandy, in 1422, and at the great battle of
Crevari in the following year.  After being joined by five
thousand comrades from Scotland, they led the furious charge
at Verneuille in 1424; and destroyed the English convoy
under the famous Sir John Fastolfe, in 1429.  The Earls of
Wigton, Buchan, and Douglas all fell in battle in one day, at
the head of the Guard, and were interred in the church of
St. Gracian, where their tombs are still to be seen.
</p>

<p>
Charmed by their unexampled valour and fidelity, Charles
VII. ordained that '<i>le Garde du Corps Ecossoises</i>' should forever
take precedence of all other troops in France.'
</p>

<p>
In 1495 they were with the French army in Italy, and
covered themselves with honour at the conquest of Naples,
when Stuart of Aubigne was created Duke of Calabria.
</p>

<p>
They served under Louis XII. against the Venetians at the
battle of Rivolta in 1509; and at the battle of Pavia, when
Francis I. fell into the hands of the foe, one hundred and
ninety-seven of the Scottish Guard lay killed and wounded
round him.  The King was taken, with <i>three</i> of his Scottish
cavaliers, and gave up his sword, exclaiming&mdash;
</p>

<p>
'Gentlemen, we have lost all but our honour!'
</p>

<p>
In 1570, the Guard was ordained to consist of a hundred
men-at-arms, a hundred archers, and twenty-four guards of
the sleeve, or keepers of the King's body; and, eight years
afterwards, at the battles of Gemblours and Mechlin, as
Father Strada tells us, they flung off their armour, and in
their doublets routed the Spaniards.
</p>

<p>
In the year I joined the Guard, there were three corps of
Scottish infantry in the French service: viz., the regiments of
Hepburn, Ramsay, and Lesly.  Like other French corps, they
consisted of several battalions.  Hepburn's had seven, each a
thousand strong.  More than twenty regiments of the French
line were led by Scottish colonels, and there were two Scottish
lieutenant-generals, James Campbell, Earl of Irvine, and
Andrew, Lord Rutherford of Hunthill; while De la Ferte
Imbault, a brave veteran, was colonel-general of all the
Scottish troops in France.
</p>

<p>
It would be vain, in a narrative like mine, to enumerate the
privileges of the Scottish Guard and people in France.
</p>

<p>
The league, in which the Garde du Corps originated,
declared that between the kingdoms of Scotland and France
there should be an inviolable confederacy and friendship for
ever; that injuries offered by the English to either, should be
punished by the troops of both; that all Scottish auxiliaries
in France should be maintained by the king of that country;
and that, if any subjects of one nation gave assistance to
England, 'by arms, counsel, or victual,' against the other,
they should be judged guilty of treason.
</p>

<p>
To these clauses, Alexander II. of Scotland, and Louis
VIII. of France, added a fifth:
</p>

<p>
That neither monarch should receive within his dominions
the foreign enemies or domestic rebels of the other.
</p>

<p>
King Robert II. of Scotland, and Charles V. of France,
added others, to this effect:
</p>

<p>
That neither of them should make peace with England
without the express consent of the other; and that the Pope
alone could absolve the two monarchs and their successors
from the oath and alliance, which were never violated,
while the British crowns remained separate.
</p>

<p>
James IV., in 1491, Henry IV. of France and Navarre,
and Marie of Guise and Lorraine, Regent of Scotland in
1558, all renewed and strengthened this league, which always
proved so troublesome to our neighbours the English; and
hence their old rhyming proverb, which is mentioned by
Shakspeare in the first act of 'Henry V.'

<h3>
CHAPTER XI.
<br /><br />
MY FIRST PARADE.
</h3>

<p>
And now, having got through the musty lore of the last
chapter, we will return to my own adventures with renewed
vigour.
</p>

<p>
A few days after my enrolment, the trumpets of the Light
Horse and Musketeers blew shrilly in the court of the Louvre,
announcing that his Majesty was leaving the Council to
proceed to mass.
</p>

<p>
The whole of the Scottish Guard were under arms; the
hundred cuirassiers on horseback in full array, with rapier,
helmet, and plume; the hundred archers, now archers but in
name, as they were armed with arquebuses, and clad in
white hocquetons, glittering with lace; and the twenty-four
chosen Scottish gentlemen, keepers of the royal body, who
never left the King of France until their hands deposited his
remains in the regal sepulchre of St. Denis, which was always
the last duty of the Scottish Guard, before they encircled the
throne of his successor.
</p>

<p>
Our commander was styled <i>first</i> captain of his Majesty's
Guards, and began the military year by serving the first
quarter of it.
</p>

<p>
The court before the Louvre presented a brilliant appearance.
The Guards of horse and foot under arms; the Grey
and the Blue Musketeers&mdash;all of whom were gentlemen of the
best families in France&mdash;richly attired, laced and plumed;
nobles, chevaliers, pages, and lacqueys, all clad in gorgeous
dresses; horses, gaily trapped, pawing the pavement, impatient
for their riders.  Amid all this glittering crowd I looked for
the carriage of the Countess d'Amboise, but nowhere could see
it, yet I was told that it was usually drawn by six white horses.
</p>

<p>
With all the vanity of youth, I was particularly anxious
that she should see me in my brilliant accoutrements, plumed,
spurred, and belted.  My gay companions laughed and made
bold jests when I inquired if she had been seen, for the secret
of my patronage had been whispered about, and the old
Marechal de Logis told me gruffly that, 'the King always
went to Madame, for Madame dared not come to the King.'
</p>

<p>
Patrick Gordon had come to parade in a bad humour that
morning.  A horseman had splashed him with mud, on the
Pont de Notre Dame, and he was making loud complaints on
the subject to the Commandant of the City Watch and the
Chevalier Livingstone.
</p>

<p>
'Zounds!' said he, curling his strong grey moustache up to
his eyes, 'he was only a rascally bourgeois, monsieur; had I
been daubed by the horse of a musketeer, or gentleman, I
should not have cared so much, but a cit&mdash;a mere cit!'
</p>

<p>
'Whom one cannot fight; it was too bad, M. le Marechal
de Logis,' replied the Captain of the Watch; 'why did you
not fling him into the Seine?'
</p>

<p>
'Of course,' added the Chevalier Livingstone; 'for a mere
bourgeois must be taught that he is not to ride everybody
down like a prince of the blood.'
</p>

<p>
'Is yonder carriage, which I see drawn by four white
horses and guarded by twelve Grey Musketeers, the equipage
of the Countess d'Amboise?' I asked.
</p>

<p>
'Always your Countess,' grumbled the Marechal; 'no, 'tis
the Queen's.'
</p>

<p>
'And why has the Countess six?'
</p>

<p>
'My bon camarado, have you yet to learn that Anne of
Austria is only the wife of the most Christian King, while
Clara d'Ische is his mistress?  This makes all the difference
in the world.'
</p>

<p>
'Our old Marechal de Logis has paraded in a bad humour
to-day,' said Raynold Cheyne, as Gordon moved his horse to
the rear of our line.
</p>

<p>
''Tis his dark day,' said the Chevalier; 'but, Blane, you
cannot know what we mean by that anniversary.'
</p>

<p>
'The day on which he lost his friend and mistress together,
by a hasty shot.'
</p>

<p>
'Thirty years ago, that is to say, in April 1605, he stood
in high favour with the beautiful Marguerite of Valois, who
was then living&mdash;and still lovely&mdash;at the old embattled
Hotel de Sens; but lo! as madame was not so discreet as
in the days of the Huguenots, one night he discovered a
rival.'
</p>

<p>
'Where?' I asked, 'in her chamber?'
</p>

<p>
'Nay, in the boot of her coach.'
</p>

<p>
'A strange place&mdash;well?'
</p>

<p>
'He fired his arquebuse through it, and killed him on the
spot.'
</p>

<p>
'The deuce; that was unpleasant!'
</p>

<p>
'After this, Marguerite quitted the Hotel de Sens for ever;
it became hateful to her.  She then built another house in the
Fauxbourg St. Germain, near the Seine, and the Pré aux
Cleres.'
</p>

<p>
'And the Marechal de Logis?'
</p>

<p>
'Lost her favour for ever; but he did not break his heart,
for Marguerite was well past forty.  He was supposed to be
her ninth lover; but hush, here he comes again.'
</p>

<p>
There was a flourishing of trumpets, a rolling of drums, a
lowering of swords and standards, an uncovering of heads,
with a general salute, as a little man, about forty years of
age, with a thin, round profile, in a broad hat and feather,
wearing a purple cloak, a prodigiously long sword, having his
poor, lean legs encased in wrinkly boots of white perfumed
leather, and with the crosses of the Holy Ghost and Notre
Dame du Mont Carmel, flashing in diamonds, on his breast,
appeared at the grand entrance of the Louvre.
</p>

<p>
He was Louis XIII.&mdash;Louis the Just, whose politics were
ever at variance with his inclinations.
</p>

<p>
He had just left the Council, where the expected war with
Lorraine and the Empire was the all-engrossing topic; and
as he descended, according to etiquette and to daily use and
wont, he gave the parole and countersign for the day to the
young and splendid Marquis de Gordon, who, as premiere
capitaine of the household troops, stood at his right hand in
his white hocqueton and with his lofty plume; he, in turn,
gave it to the officers of the Scottish Guard, and to the
colonels of the Gensdarmes, Dragoons, and Musketeers; and
then the King gave (what he deemed of much more importance)
special orders to the keepers of the kennels about
his favourite dogs, as he was a passionate lover of the
chase&mdash;such as it is in France.
</p>

<p>
By the King's side stalked Richelieu, with a stately step,
his keen, hawk-like eyes and prominent cheek-bones full of
cunning, and his firm lip and well-defined chin bespeaking
dogged perseverance.  I gazed with undefined interest upon
this lofty prelate, so terrible for his political intrigues, his
perspicacity, his subtlety, inflexibility, and revenge.
</p>

<p>
Around them were the royal confessor, Father Leslie,
Principal of the Jesuit College of Toulouse, a tall, grave,
and stern-looking Scot; the Masters of the Horse and of the
Household; the Grand Chamberlain, M. le Duc de Bouillon,
who was entirely dressed in cloth of gold, and the four
gentlemen of the chamber&mdash;viz., the Dukes de Gevrès, de la
Tremouille, de la Beauvillier, and d'Aumont; with the four
Captains of the Scots and French Gardes du Corps&mdash;the
Marquis de Gordon being on the King's right hand.  Then
came the Grand Almoner and the officers of the chapel; the
Admiral of France; the General of the Galleys; the Grand
Master of the Artillery; the Grand Ecuyer; the Colonel-General
of the French Guards, and the Premier President of
the Parliament of Paris.  Here I also saw the veteran John
Louis, Duc d'Epernon, Colonel-General of France and
Governor of Guyenne, the oldest peer, general, and knight in
the kingdom; Lieutenant-General Francis de Bethune, Surveyor
of France, Governor of St. Maixant, and once Campmaster of
the ancient Regiment de Picardie; Philibert de Nerestan,
the aged Grand Master of the Knights of St. Lazare, and the
Duc de St. Simon, whom Louis XIII. had made a peer and
marshal of France because he was a good judge of dogs, and
could blow on a hunting-horn without spitting through it.
</p>

<p>
This fortunate peer was in close conversation with the
Abbé la Rivière, the first man who ever wore a peruke; and
such was the profusion of its curls, that it weighed two
pounds&mdash;to make up for the lightness of his brain, as my
comrade the Viscount suggested.
</p>

<p>
'Bravo, M. l'Abbé!' said Raynold Cheyne; 'a dealer in
souls with a perfumed periwig!'
</p>

<p>
Surrounded by musketeers and light horse, with the
twenty-four gentlemen of the Scottish Guard, who were the
immediate custodiers of the royal person, and escorted by all
these peers and soldiers of high rank and sounding name,
glittering with jewels, embroidery, and brilliant dresses of
silk, velvet, cloth of gold, and cloth of silver, and having all
the knightly orders of Europe sparkling on their breasts&mdash;Louis
was conducted to solemn high mass in the chapel of the
Louvre, where the Grand Almoner had all his staff waiting
to perform one of those grand musical efforts, which shook the
building to its centre.
</p>

<p>
The moment mass was over, the King repaired to luncheon,
after seeing his hounds fed, however, and then we were
dismissed.  I galloped to our stables, gave Dagobert, my
Spanish barb, to his groom, and without taking time to change
my trappings, threw myself into a fiacre, or hackney-coach,
and ordered the driver to spare neither whip nor speed until
he reached the chateau d'Amboise, as I had not seen my
patroness for four entire days.
</p>

<p><br /><br /><br /></p>

<p><a id="chap12"></a></p>

<h3>
CHAPTER XII.
<br /><br />
THE MOTH AND THE CANDLE.
</h3>

<p>
Remembering the injunctions of the Countess, I avoided the
elaborately-carved Porte Cochère, under which a few of the
Comte de Treville's musketeers were loitering&mdash;so publicly
and in defiance of all scandal did Louis XIII. honour this
lady with his favour; and dismissing the fiacre at an angle of
the road, I made a detour among the trees of the lawn, and
reached unseen the little private postern door, which was
hidden in a corner of the château, between a broad round
tower and a mass of clematis, that overhung a species of
bastion projecting into the fosse.  The latter was now drained
and covered with the smoothest turf.  Here I rang a bell,
and on being admitted by Antoine, was at once conducted by
a private staircase to the apartments of the Countess.
</p>

<p>
Antoine ushered me into a reception-room, which had
hangings of violet-coloured silk, starred with silver, and
furniture of walnut-wood, exquisitely carved.  Through an
arch, festooned with yellow brocade on one side, I saw the
sleeping apartment of the Countess, and it was worthy of her
beauty.  The bed was of richly-carved wood; the curtains
were of rose-coloured velvet, and at the head was framed in
oak a curious Flemish painting of the loves of Vertumnus and
Pomona, taken from Ovid.
</p>

<p>
On the other side an archway, also festooned with yellow
brocade, revealed an antechamber, hung with saffron-coloured
damask, and on an ebony table a magnificent ruby-coloured
Bohemian dessert-service, all pencilled in gold; dishes of
silver piled with fruit, and vases and flasks of wine in iced
coolers were arranged for a repast.
</p>

<p>
'The devil!' thought I; 'this is unlucky: madame expects
some one, for here is a dessert of love apples and wine of
Artois!'
</p>

<p>
I observed myself in an opposite mirror, and was struck by
the splendour of my own appearance in the uniform of the
guard; but my brows were knit, and I said aloud&mdash;
</p>

<p>
'Absurd;&mdash;is this jealousy?'
</p>

<p>
'I hope not, my dear M. Blane, for love alone enters
here,' said a soft voice; and turning, I saw Madame d'Amboise,
in a robe of blue powdered with gold fleurs de lis, and
looking so lovely that I was almost bewildered, when kissing
her white hand, which was smooth as the finest velvet; then
she smiled with that unmistakable air of pleasure and
coquetry, which always lights up the countenance of a
charming woman at the effect produced by her own beauty.  Her
invariable attendant, the delicate girl with the golden hair,
withdrew abruptly as we met.
</p>

<p>
My first inquiry was for the Chevalier d'Ische, her brother.
</p>

<p>
'Oh! he is almost well, and is quite able to walk; but
you&mdash;oh, you are so welcome, M. Blane! and you charm me
by this visit.  I was longing so much to hear the sound of
your voice again.  I see you will make it your duty to please
me.'
</p>

<p>
'Could I but hope to succeed.'
</p>

<p>
'Let not your heart fail.'
</p>

<p>
'It fails already, madame.'
</p>

<p>
'Because I am half in love with you.'
</p>

<p>
'Only half?' she exclaimed, merrily; 'oh, fie, M. Blane!'
</p>

<p>
'I dare not be more, madam,' I sighed, with a strange
mixture of fear, admiration, and perplexity; 'your beauty
awes me.'
</p>

<p>
'You will become used to it in time; alas! it is the fate of
beauty.  Come hither,' said she, motioning me to a seat
beside her on the down fauteuil, and smiling brilliantly, with
a gratification that she cared not to conceal.  'Look at these
brilliants,' she added, opening a scarlet case; 'they were
brought to me this morning.'
</p>

<p>
'From Paris?'
</p>

<p>
'Jealous again!  From the Louvre, by M. Boizenval.'
</p>

<p>
'The King's valet?'
</p>

<p>
'Yes; and he announced that the King might visit me
to-day, hence this collation, towards which your eyes wander so
suspiciously.  Oh, poor jealous M. Arthur; but what think
you of this necklace?'
</p>

<p>
'It would grace the neck of Anne of Austria; but you,
madame, require no aid from ornament.'
</p>

<p>
'Little fellow, you flatter me already!  I have promised
M. Poussin, the painter, a sitting to-day; do you think that
with these jewels and with this dress I shall make a good
picture?'
</p>

<p>
'Madame, you would make a divine picture in any dress,'
said I, carried away by the impulse of the moment.
</p>

<p>
'Mon Dieu, my boy, what a lover you will make!  Who
among the Garde du Corps Ecossais will be like you?'
</p>

<p>
As I had now come to push my fortune in France and in
Paris, that place of vague and doubtful morality, I
had&mdash;fortunately for myself&mdash;at memory all the dialogues, proverbs,
and 'metrical graces' of the <i>French Schoole Maister</i>, published
at Edinburgh in 1632; and drew my ideas of continental
morals from that small thick volume the <i>Histoire de Palmerin
d'Olive, Fils du Roy Florendos</i>, translated from Castilian into
French by Jean Maugin, <i>Paris, par Galliot du Pre</i>, 1573:
thus I was never without a ready answer whenever the
Countess threw down the glove.  Moreover, I was young, and
knew little of the world; thus her great beauty and brilliance
of manner really dazzled me; and when I bent my eyes upon
her, I am ashamed to say, that it was, perhaps, with more
of an imploring expression than ever filled them when I
attempted to pray; but I soon forgot to do even that in
Paris.
</p>

<p>
After some conversation of a half-bantering and
half-complimentary nature, with a strong tinge of love-making
running through it all, I begged that she would give me a
little relic to wear, as a remembrance of one who had been so
kind to me.  Taking from the drawer of a buhl table a
charming miniature of herself, set in gold, she threw its
ribbon round my neck, saying in a whisper close to my ear,
very close indeed,&mdash;
</p>

<p>
'Wear this for my sake&mdash;it is the work of Nicholas
Poussin, and the gift of a king.  See his initial L, and a
crown in diamonds, are on the back.  It may prove a talisman
should you ever get into trouble; for, alas! the court of
France is surrounded by pitfalls and snares, by lures and
assassinations.'
</p>

<p>
'Ah, madame, that I might always be near you.'
</p>

<p>
'Why that wish?'
</p>

<p>
'Forgive me,' said I, kissing the miniature, and placing it
in my breast; 'but I feel myself attracted towards you by an
irresistible fatality, like&mdash;'
</p>

<p>
'Like what, mon bien amie?'
</p>

<p>
'Like a poor moth towards the light, which is to consume
and destroy it!' said I, with more real pathos and feeling than
the object of this emotion merited.
</p>

<p>
'A terrible simile! then, M. Arthur, you love me <i>wholly</i>
now?'
</p>

<p>
'Oh, Madame la Comtesse, you know not how devotedly.'
</p>

<p>
'Have you nothing better to tell me than all this farrago?'
she asked coquettishly.
</p>

<p>
'Could I tell you ought that was more interesting?' said I,
dropping my cheek upon her soft white shoulder.
</p>

<p>
'Interesting, mon Dieu! to yourself, perhaps.'
</p>

<p>
'And to you, too, dearest Countess; for you love me in
return, I know that you do.'
</p>

<p>
'Well, perhaps I do love you a little; but remember that
my love is like fortune.'
</p>

<p>
'How?'
</p>

<p>
'Fickle.'
</p>

<p>
'Alas! do not say so,' said I, clasping her waist.  'Do
you remember a promise you made me?'
</p>

<p>
'A promise?' she reiterated, casting down her long lashes,
'I do not remember; what was it?'
</p>

<p>
'That you would give me one of your garters to wear, as
M. de Chatillon wears that of Mademoiselle de Guerchi round
his sword-arm.'
</p>

<p>
'Yes; but, my poor boy, it would bring you to the wheel,
perhaps.'
</p>

<p>
At that moment while my heart beat like lightning, and a
flame seemed before my eyes, the thick arras was hastily
drawn aside, and the visage of Antoine&mdash;the discreet
Antoine&mdash;appeared, with the greatest alarm depicted thereon; his
eyes were arched to the roots of his hair.
</p>

<p>
'O Madame la Comtesse,' he exclaimed; 'le Roi! place
pour sa Majesté le Roi!'
</p>

<p>
We sprang from the fauteuil in consternation.
</p>

<p>
'Enter here,' said the Countess, opening the heavy-carved
door of a dark Flemish cabinet; 'quick, quick, M. Arthur.'
</p>

<p>
'Ah, Countess, if the King becomes tender!' said I.
</p>

<p>
'Well, what then?'
</p>

<p>
'I may not be able to control my anger.'
</p>

<p>
'What! you will re-enact Ravaillac here, and make my old
cabinet historical, like the house of M. Pontrain, the Notary,
in the Ferronerie,' said she, laughing; 'bah! you silly boy:
Louis XIII. tender!  Mon Dieu, there is no danger of that.
In, in; there are times, like this, when one's dearest friends
become, like his Majesty, a decided bore!' and pushing me in
with her pretty hands, she locked the door, at which, to my
great alarm, her little devil of a dog continued to snuff and
snort for a time.

<h3>
CHAPTER XIII.
<br /><br />
LOUIS THE THIRTEENTH.
</h3>

<p>
Leaving me in some danger of suffocation, and to my own
reflections, among which the warnings of the Marquis de
Gordon occupied a prominent place, the fair Countess had just
time to conceal the key of the cabinet in her bosom, when the
arras rose and fell, and Louis XIII. stood before her, with his
broad plumed hat under his left arm, and wearing a short
velvet cloak and long silver-hilted sword, tilting it up behind
him as he continued to bow and advance with a mincing jaunty
step, and ended by kissing the hand of the Countess thrice.
At his neck hung the plain gold cross usually worn by him
when he officiated as one of the twenty canons of the cathedral
church of Ambrun&mdash;a solemn farce.
</p>

<p>
Louis the Just&mdash;so named because in an age which was still
infected by the poisonings and astrologies of the infamous
Catherine de Medicis, he had been born under the sign of the
Zodiac, called <i>Libra</i>, or the Balance&mdash;was not of a very
amorous nature; but being left almost entirely alone even
amid the splendour of his court, and being coldly treated by
Anne of Austria his queen, who, like all the great people of
Paris, followed in the retinue of the formidable Cardinal
Richelieu, his minister and, scandal added, her lover, he had
but two or three domestics whom he loved and trusted;
and who, besides the huntsmen and hounds, were his chief
favourites and companions.  Among these was particularly
Boizenval, his valet de chambre, who usually bore his presents
and love letters to Clara, but whom he banished in 1637,
for delivering all his tender billets doux&mdash;especially those
addressed to the fair and unfortunate Fayette&mdash;<i>first</i> to the
tyrannical, prying and overweening Cardinal premier, to whose
care, as well as to that of 'our blessed Lady,' Louis boasted
he had consigned his crown and kingdom, and so troubled
himself no more about them, believing like his successor, that
'they would last <i>his</i> time.'
</p>

<p>
Gallantry had been gradually resolving itself into a grand
system during his reign.  The brilliant assemblies and gay
circles by which Francis I., of magnificent memory, had
encouraged the polished intercourse of his court; the gross
sensuality which had been introduced by the wicked and
Machiavelian Catherine de Medicis, whose fair dames of
honour lured to death their Huguenot lovers; when 'murders
were hatched in the arms of love, and massacre was planned in
the cabinet of pleasure;' with the shameless libertinism of
Henry IV., were all united now to the serious gallantry which
Anne of Austria had brought with her from Spain; and thus
under Louis XIII.&mdash;though he was very little of a gallant
himself&mdash;love, in his good city of Paris, became a science like
astrology, and was analysed like metaphysics; and thus, as I
have said, it was formed into a system, which rendered it the
serious occupation of every one, and the way was easily prepared
for that more absurd state of things which we find under
the Grand Monarque his successor, when affairs of state were
debated, and solemn councils of war held, round a courtesan
lounging on a sofa, or in a pretty woman's bedroom; and
when a revolution in the heart of a great man's mistress was
an event of nearly as much consequence as a war on the
Rhine, or an invasion of Flanders.  But to resume&mdash;
</p>

<p>
'What the deuce is this I hear now, ma belle?' said the
King, as he seated himself just where I had sat a moment
before; 'here is the <i>Mercure Francois</i> publicly affirming&mdash;for
M. Richelieu never tells me anything&mdash;that Mademoiselle
Marie Louise of Lorraine&mdash;Duke Charles' daughter&mdash;is now
in Paris, with her brother the Prince of Vaudemont, suborning
my officers.  'Tis a serious thing to assert!'
</p>

<p>
''Tis impossible, sire!' exclaimed the Countess, changing
colour very visibly; 'and that is more than improbable.'
</p>

<p>
'Nothing is impossible to those accursed Lorraines.'
</p>

<p>
'Your Majesty forgets that I am of Lorraine,' said the
Countess with considerable hauteur.
</p>

<p>
'Nay, pardon me; but I had hoped you had been long
enough in Paris to forget that wicked province.'
</p>

<p>
'Lorraine is an independent duchy, sire.'
</p>

<p>
'<i>Was</i> you mean, madame, till Henry II., in 1552, reduced
it to obedience under the oriflamme, and left there a garrison
which cost Charles V. some trouble, and thirty thousand of
the best soldiers in Spain too!  Moreover Metz, Toul, and
Verdun were all confirmed to France by the treaty of Château
Cambresis in '59.
</p>

<p>
'Your Majesty is excessively tiresome.'
</p>

<p>
'I regret to hear it; but how is this, sweetheart,' said
Louis, knitting his brows as he surveyed the glittering dress
of the lovely Countess; 'will nothing content you but a robe
of blue, powdered with fleurs-de-lis?'
</p>

<p>
'It becomes me, sire, does it not?'
</p>

<p>
'Who alone are permitted to wear such?'
</p>

<p>
'Princesses of the blood royal; but am not I the life of
your heart?'
</p>

<p>
'Under Henry IV., even the Duchess de Vendosme dared
not have worn these, after she was publicly affronted by the
Count de Soissons for doing so.'
</p>

<p>
'Henry IV. was a bear who should never have left the
woods of the Lower Pyrenees.  Your Majesty is in a horrible
humour this morning; but here is luncheon, and there are
chessmen&mdash;which do you prefer to me?'
</p>

<p>
'Neither, sweetheart, yet I will have you all; luncheon
now, chess after, and you all the while.'
</p>

<p>
With these words the capricious King sat down to table,
and was assisted to various niceties by the white hands of the
Countess, with whom he afterwards sat down to chess, of which
he was so passionately fond that he played it in his carriage,
where the men were pegs inserted into holes in the squares of
a perforated board, so that the motion could not displace them.
</p>

<p>
'Ah, Countess,' he mumbled as the game began, 'you have
the most adorable hands heaven ever formed!'
</p>

<p>
'Yet they are the hands of a Lorrainer.'
</p>

<p>
'Have you ever seen this Marie Louise, of whom all men
talk?'
</p>

<p>
'No;' replied the Countess, coldly; 'but why, sire?'
</p>

<p>
'Because we are told that she is full of the most dangerous
beauty, united to the sweetest sensibility.'
</p>

<p>
'Ah; she is cunning perhaps, and is one of those who rule
by tender glances, tears and sighs, or by an affectation of
enthusiasm she never feels.  I have known many women of
this kind.'
</p>

<p>
'You are piqued, my dear Countess&mdash;she is a mere girl&mdash;a
child.'
</p>

<p>
'So is the Duchess de Montbazon&mdash;yet she has had eight
lovers.'
</p>

<p>
'You are severe, Clara; Madame de Montbazon is the
wife of a peer of France.'
</p>

<p>
'I care not&mdash;for every lover she has, I could easily reckon
ten, were I not devoted to your Majesty.'
</p>

<p>
'Thank you&mdash;but you forget your game.'
</p>

<p>
'Ah! sire&mdash;a woman forgets the universe itself, when he
whom she truly loves is present.'
</p>

<p>
'Thou flatterest me, Clara,' said the poor silly King,
trembling with pleasure, and in turn playing the deuce with his
game.
</p>

<p>
'And now I have two or three pretty little requests to
make.'
</p>

<p>
'Peste!  I thought so.  Did not the jewels I sent by
M. Boizenval satisfy you?'
</p>

<p>
'Oh! sire, my letter of thanks expressed all I felt&mdash;but you
mean not to grudge them to your Clara?'
</p>

<p>
'No&mdash;no!&mdash;and this request&mdash;'
</p>

<p>
'Monseigneur&mdash;(I did not catch the name) departed to the
company of the saints yesterday, and has left a fine estate, the
baton of a marshal of France, the cross of Saint Esprit, and a
regiment of dragoons behind him.'
</p>

<p>
'Well,' said the King, wincing, and making a grimace;
''tis fortunate that he could not take them all to heaven with
him, as I wanted them sorely.'
</p>

<p>
'So do I&mdash;the baton for Colonel Hepburn, the Scot, who
dresses so magnificently&mdash;the cross, and the colonelcy of
horse, I leave to your Majesty.
</p>

<p>
'Thank you, madame, you are exceedingly liberal; Hepburn,
shall have his baton, I promise you; but not until he has
marched into Lorraine.'
</p>

<p>
'Sire, the cross of the Holy Ghost, vacant by the execution
of the Duke de Montmorenci, Campmaster of the regiment de
Normandie, is not yet filled up.'
</p>

<p>
'Well?'
</p>

<p>
'I wish it, if you love me,' said the Countess, starting from
the table, and throwing her arms round Louis.
</p>

<p>
'What&mdash;Countess, you with a cross of my first order?'
</p>

<p>
'Marion de l'Orme got one of St. Sepulchre, from the
Cardinal, for her lover Senecterre.'
</p>

<p>
'And for whom do <i>you</i> wish it?' asked the King, suspiciously.
</p>

<p>
'For no lover, but a friend who will give me a thousand
crowns for it&mdash;Raynold Cheyne of the Scottish Guard.'
</p>

<p>
'The cross worn by a peer and marshal of France, the
descendant of four constables, one whose patent dates, like our
Scottish League, from Charles the Great, for a private
gentleman of our guard?  Peste!&mdash;well, well, 'tis yours, Clara.'
</p>

<p>
'Thanks, sire,' said she, kissing him.
</p>

<p>
'Ha! what noise is that in the cabinet?&mdash;see, your dog
snarls as if some one&mdash;'
</p>

<p>
''Tis mice, only mice, sire; but here are pen and ink;
please to confirm these gifts; I deserve them, since I have
been able to anticipate my enemy, the Cardinal.'
</p>

<p>
The King confirmed them by a line or two, which he
handed to the Countess, saying,
</p>

<p>
'There is no man in all the Scottish Guard, I value more
than Raynold Cheyne, or would trust more&mdash;'
</p>

<p>
'With anything, but a pretty girl, sire.'
</p>

<p>
'True, Madame de Bouillon has quite spoiled him; but
favours to our soldiers are not thrown away at present; we
have this day decided on the war with Lorraine.'
</p>

<p>
Through a chink in the old cabinet, I could perceive the
Countess start with visible emotion at these words, and as she
gave a furtive glance towards a part of the arras, I thought
that a fair face, and a tress of golden hair were visible for a
moment, as if some one was listening.
</p>

<p>
'Would not your Majesty rather send an envoy to the
Duke, and seek to arbitrate this matter?'
</p>

<p>
'Countess, Richelieu means to send two envoys.'
</p>

<p>
'He does, sire!'
</p>

<p>
'Yes&mdash;the Cardinal Duke de Lavalette, and your friend
the Camp-Marechal Hepburn.'
</p>

<p>
'How&mdash;'
</p>

<p>
'With fifty thousand men.'
</p>

<p>
'Alas! my poor native province!'
</p>

<p>
'Such is our resolve.'
</p>

<p>
'And which way do they march?'
</p>

<p>
'By the road direct for the frontier, and Elsace Zaberne.'
</p>

<p>
Another glance, and most palpable nod of intelligence were
exchanged between the Countess and the eavesdropper, whom
I suspected to be her attendant.
</p>

<p>
'If this Duke of Lorraine had four heads, by the bones of
St. Louis, I would spike them all on the gate of St. Marcel,
beside that of the traitor Guy de Beaumanoir!'
</p>

<p>
'Before that happens, I fear me, that the little Dauphin
will have been hailed as Louis XIV.'
</p>

<p>
'Indeed, Countess!' said the King, with a sardonic grimace.
</p>

<p>
'Yes, sire, and you will be on your way to St. Denis, borne
by the twenty-four Scots of the Garde du Corps.'
</p>

<p>
'Perhaps so,' said the easy King; 'but mort de tout les
diables! let us have no more of politics, for I love to avoid
them, and to come here when I am weary of display.  The
parade and routine of royalty are veritable slavery.  Do you
remember that fool the Prince of Condé entering Paris in
1616 with no less than fifteen hundred nobles and chevaliers
and a thousand partizans in his train, and how he alarmed our
royal mother, Mary de Medicis, who thought he had come to
sack the city?  By-the-by, in that year she had just finished
the Hotel de Gondi to the tune of forty thousand crowns.'
</p>

<p>
'Sire, you forget that in 1616 I was but a girl,' said the
Countess, pouting again.
</p>

<p>
'Four o'clock,' said the King, rising, as the hall-clock of
the château struck in the turret of the quadrangle; 'and I
promised to meet the grand huntsman and grand falconer
at Versailles this evening about some little improvements I
am making in the kennels and falconry.  Fortunately,
M. Richelieu does not interfere with <i>them</i>.  I must go.'
</p>

<p>
'So soon, sire!'
</p>

<p>
'But you will accompany me, Countess, I hope.'
</p>

<p>
'If your Majesty would excuse me&mdash;'
</p>

<p>
She paused, for the pettish Louis knit his brow.
</p>

<p>
'Countess!'&mdash;he began impressively.
</p>

<p>
'This morning I was so unwell, and slept so little&mdash;'
</p>

<p>
''Tis the mice in this old château, Countess,' said the King,
glancing round him suspiciously; 'and this old cabinet&mdash;some
of M. le Duc de Sully's furniture,' he added, giving it a
knock that made my heart to leap, 'seems a very receptacle
for them.  We must have it broken and burned!'
</p>

<p>
The Countess was terrified.
</p>

<p>
'I will go, sire,' she faltered.
</p>

<p>
'Thanks, dear Clara; your hand.'
</p>

<p>
He led her out with his jaunty step again, and they retired.
</p>

<p>
I heard the wheels of the royal carriage in the avenue a
moment after, and then the hoofs of the musketeer escort.  As
these sounds died away, my heart sank within me, for I was
locked in the cabinet, and its key was in the bosom of the
Countess, who might return to release me heaven alone knew
when!
</p>

<p><br /><br /><br /></p>

<p><a id="chap14"></a></p>

<h3>
CHAPTER XIV.
<br /><br />
THE OAK CABINET.
</h3>

<p>
My reflections were of a somewhat chequered nature.  The
amorous dalliance I had observed, and the conversation I had
been forced to overhear, shocked and cooled, while it
exasperated me.  On one hand I found the Countess evidently
taking money from officers, peers, and gentlemen for titles
and crosses cajoled from the facile king; and on the other, I
perceived her drawing from him intelligence concerning the
intended war against the Duke of Lorraine, in whose secret
interest she and her attendant, as natives of his duchy, were
perhaps naturally enough enlisted.  Then I thought of my
present predicament&mdash;locked up in a secret cabinet, in a
remote part of this ancient château, where my outcries might
be unheard.  Clara might be induced, or perhaps by circumstances
compelled, to remain at Versailles for a night; perhaps
for three nights, or even longer!
</p>

<p>
The perspiration burst over me with this idea!
</p>

<p>
I was for duty next day at the Louvre, and if I did not
appear&mdash;&mdash;  I strove to break open the door of the oak cabinet,
but it was strong and immovable as the face of a bastion.
</p>

<p>
While these thoughts were passing through my mind I
heard a voice singing the burden of the old provincial song,&mdash;
</p>

<p class="poem">
  'Vive le tils d'Harlette,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Normands,<br />
  Vive le fils d'Harlette!'<br />
</p>

<p class="noindent">
and two cavaliers richly dressed, and each armed with sword
and dagger, and a pair of handsome pistols suspended by silver
hooks from their belts, entered laughing, and evidently bent
on a frolic.  In one I recognized the Chevalier d'Ische.  He
was still pale from the effects of his wound.  The other, I had
no doubt, was his companion on that night of the brawl about
the girl Nicola in the Place de la Grève.
</p>

<p>
'Prince, are your pistols loaded?' asked the Chevalier.
</p>

<p>
'Mordieu!  I should think so.  But why?'
</p>

<p>
'Dost see the carved face on the door of that old
worm-eaten cabinet?'
</p>

<p>
'A satyr's head among leaves&mdash;yes.'
</p>

<p>
''Tis just where a man's breast would be.'
</p>

<p>
'Well?'
</p>

<p>
'Ten louis to a denier you don't hit it, Prince.'
</p>

<p>
'Done!  But how if the shot is heard?'
</p>

<p>
'Diable! what do I care?'
</p>

<p>
'But the Countess's antique cabinet!'
</p>

<p>
''Tis only an old wooden box at best.'
</p>

<p>
'But the Countess&mdash;'
</p>

<p>
'Tush!'
</p>

<p>
'What will she say?'
</p>

<p>
'Say&mdash;morbleu, M. le Prince&mdash;what she pleases.  Will
you fire?'
</p>

<p>
'Peste! since you will have it so,' muttered the other,
drawing a pistol from his girdle.
</p>

<p>
'You fear my challenge?'
</p>

<p>
'Tudieu!  Chevalier, I fear nothing!'
</p>

<p>
The reader may imagine my sensations during this challenge
to a trial of skill.  I remembered the story Raynold Cheyne
and the Chevalier Livingstone had told me, of our Marechal de
Logis shooting a man in the boot of the queen's carriage, at
the Hotel de Sens; and though my soul seemed to tremble
within me, at the sudden prospect of death, true to the spirit
of honour and of the age, I held my breath, and while my
heart forgot to beat, I resolved to die rather than speak, or
disgrace the Countess by uttering a sound.
</p>

<p>
The Prince cocked and levelled his pistol.
</p>

<p>
The Chevalier uttered a loud laugh, arrested his arm, and
springing forward, unlocked and opened the door of the
cabinet, saying,
</p>

<p>
'Come forth, M. Blane&mdash;by Jupiter, how pale you look!'
</p>

<p>
'Morbleu! but you are a gallant fellow!' exclaimed he
(who was styled Prince), with astonishment; 'I knew not
that there was any one within.'
</p>

<p>
'He is brave as Bayard!  I knew of it, and did this but to
test his courage.'
</p>

<p>
'How knew you that I was in the cabinet, Chevalier?' I
asked, leaping out.
</p>

<p>
'Nicola, the Countess's attendant&mdash;'
</p>

<p>
'She with the beautiful hair?' said I.
</p>

<p>
'Ah&mdash;thou hast observed that!' said the Prince, knitting
his brows.
</p>

<p>
'How could I fail to do so?  Well, and the pretty
Mademoiselle Nicola&mdash;'
</p>

<p>
'Brought me the key of the cabinet, which, with a
significant glance, the Countess threw to her from the carriage
unseen, as she drove off with the King; and mademoiselle told
me to release you.  But, my friend, to be one of the Scottish
Guard, you are engaged in a perilous game, I think.  Peste! if
King Louis discovers you playing at bo-peep in Clara's
apartment, I would not give much for your chance of
promotion, unless at the Place de la Grève.'
</p>

<p>
'These risks are my own, Chevalier,' I replied coldly; 'but
pray what Prince is this whom I have the honour of being
before?'
</p>

<p>
'Your word of honour that you will not mention his name
to any one?'
</p>

<p>
I gave the promise, laying a hand on my heart.
</p>

<p>
'Allow me to make known to each other,' said the Chevalier,
with somewhat of a mock reverence, 'M. Arthur Blane,
of the Garde du Corps Ecossais, and Monseigneur the Prince
of Vaudemont.'
</p>

<p>
'Son of Charles IV. of Lorraine!' I exclaimed, aghast.
</p>

<p>
'The same&mdash;Duke Charles, for whom I am governor of
the city of La Mothe, and bailiff of Bassignie.  Oho! we
have been spending a jovial month in Paris, overhearing and
overseeing all King Louis' pretty little preparations for a war
upon the Rhine, and we shall be delighted to see you in
Lorraine, and all other brave gallants of the Guard.  Ma
foi! but we will perfume your new moustaches for you!  To-morrow,
or so, will be the grand ceremony of taking the terrible banner
of the oriflamme from St. Denis; but we shall see that too.
And now, my dear M. Blane, away to Paris as fast as you
may!  You are acting rashly, as others have done before you;
but beware of your game, and that king Louis does not checkmate
you; for this cabinet has more than once led to the
Bastille.'
</p>

<p>
'Thanks, M. d'Ische; but why do you concern yourself
about me?'
</p>

<p>
'Because you are a bold fellow, whose hands can keep his
head.  But away, I tell you; in Lorraine we will meet ere long,
and try again those little sword-thrusts which we exchanged
so awkwardly on the Quai de la Grève.'
</p>

<p>
'Come with us, monsieur,' said the Prince, a handsome and
winning young man, 'we have a fiacre in waiting to take me
to Paris.  We go to Marion de l'Orme's to-night, disguised as
officers of Swiss, and we will set you down at the Pont de
Notre Dame.'
</p>

<p>
'Allons,' said the Chevalier; 'let us begone then.'
</p>

<p>
An hour after this, we separated at the bridge of the Seine:
they wheeled off to the salons of the most beautiful but most
dissipated woman in Paris; whilst I, glad to be rid of
companions so dangerous as the spies and enemies of the King,
returned slowly, thoughtfully, and somewhat crest-fallen, to
the Louvre.
</p>

<h3>
CHAPTER XV.
<br /><br />
NICOLA.
</h3>

<p>
After these occurrences, a fortnight elapsed, and during all
that time I did not visit the Countess, and I never received
any message from her, a circumstance which rather piqued
and surprised me; so, during that fortnight I imitated a little
of the dissipation of my companions.
</p>

<p>
One night Raynold Cheyne and I had a desperate brawl
in the Rue St. Honoré with the archers of the Provost des
Marchands, led by the Chevalier de Guet, or commander of the
night watch; but we knocked them over like nine-pins, and
fought our way off.  Moreover, in this devilish fortnight, I
was involved in no less than two duels, having to fight one for
myself and another for a friend.
</p>

<p>
I had become acquainted with a pretty little actress of the
Hotel d'Argent aux Marais, and we used to take occasional
rambles together in the Garden of Plants, and have other
meetings, which were duly arranged for us by little Foquelin,
the <i>Molière</i> of later times.  These proceedings one of M. de
Treville's musketeers resented so highly, that he asked me to
give him a meeting, which I did one morning about five
o'clock.  Why abroad so early? the reader may ask; but the
truth is, that to suit my own convenience I met him on my
way home to the Louvre.  We engaged, but after a few
passes he burst into a fit of laughter, sheathed his sword, and
proposed that we should toss up for my actress over a bottle
of the wine of Artois, which we did accordingly, and, as
fortune would have it, she fell to him.
</p>

<p>
My next affair was more serious.
</p>

<p>
Our comrade, the Viscount Dundrennan, when crossing at
the ferry of the Nesle, was incommoded by a chevalier of
St. Esprit, and a meeting was arranged; but the Viscount having
to attend an assignation with a little citoyenne, in the Marais,
asked me to take his place; and, wearing his rocquelaure and a
lofty plume, by which he was as well known in Paris as the
statue of Henry IV., I met the chevalier of St. Esprit outside
the gate of St. Marcel, and at the fourth pass disarmed and
laid him flat on his back by a blow with my shell on the
mouth.  As he was a friend of Mademoiselle de l'Orme, I
feared that for this exploit I might have to cool my heels in
Holland, and take service under those very pious and proper
persons, the States General; but the Countess stood my
friend with the Procureur du Roi, the Chevalier got a false
set of teeth, the affair blew over, and Dundrennan was my
friend for life.
</p>

<p>
One night I was sentinel at a private gate of the Louvre,
armed completely, in helmet, breast and back plates, with
sword and carbine.  My orders simply were, to admit none
by that postern without receiving from them the parole, which,
as already related, the King daily gave to the Marquis de
Gordon.  In the chapel of the ancient palace, Louis was
holding a solemn chapter of the fifty knights of the Holy
Ghost (an order instituted by himself), for the purpose of
receiving my friend, Cheyne of Dundargle, whose new honours
were owing to the interest taken in his affairs by Madame
d'Amboise.
</p>

<p>
I had still the miniature of that gay countess, and while
whistling or humming an air to wile away the lonely two
hours of my watch, I occasionally, by a lamp that hung
overhead, surveyed this effort of the pencil of Poussin, who
had caught with wonderful skill her voluptuous style of
beauty, the wanton lustre that shone in her rich hazel eye,
and the seductive droop of her eyelash.
</p>

<p>
Two old crones connected with the palace amused me for
some time by gravely discussing whether Madame la Marechale
d'Ancre really lodged devils at her house in Paris, and
consequently deserved the stake; and then of the newer sorceries
of Urbain Grandier among the poor nuns at Loudun, in the
Vienne, which began to be much talked of about that time;
and as all the ladies were in turn possessed by devils, which were
only expelled by bringing them before a statue of our Lady of
Recovery, the Carmelites, its possessors, were making quite a
fortune by the fame of its miracles.  After a little, the two
crones shut their windows, and all became still and silent,
save the strains of music that came at times from the
illuminated windows of the Hôtel de Bourbon, which stood opposite;
and now the time approached when the venerable clock of
St. Germain l'Auxerrois would toll the hour for relieving me
until morning.
</p>

<p>
A dark figure, about a pistol-shot distant, glided across the
rays of light that fell from the Hotel windows towards the
postern, and attracted my attention.
</p>

<p>
'Qui vive?' I challenged.
</p>

<p>
Without replying, a female, masked, and shrouded from
head to foot in a long black veil, approached hurriedly, and, to
my great surprise, laid a hand timidly upon my arm, saying&mdash;
</p>

<p>
'Ah!  M. Arthur, I overheard some one say you were on
duty here.'
</p>

<p>
'At your service, mademoiselle,' I replied, while my heart
beat rapidly on recognising my little masker of the Place de
la Grève, Nicola, the attendant of the Countess; 'but why
are you alone here, and at this time of night?'
</p>

<p>
'Why was I alone that night in the Quai de la Grève?'
</p>

<p>
'I know not; you are a charming enigma, Nicola; but
twelve will strike shortly.  Ah! mademoiselle, if you have a
lover!'
</p>

<p>
'I have been at the masque in the Hotel de Bourbon; I
have been close to the Cardinal twenty times, and heard him
discuss some notable projects with the Chevalier Hepburn and
the Duke de Lavalette.'
</p>

<p>
'Projects&mdash;concerning what?'
</p>

<p>
'The war in Lorraine.'
</p>

<p>
'Then your information will be of considerable value to
my friend, M. le Chevalier d'Ische,' said I, angrily.
</p>

<p>
'Hush!' said she, haughtily, and with alarm, while she
cast a rapid glance over the mighty mass of the Louvre;
'it is not of d'Ische, but of yourself I came to speak.'
</p>

<p>
'A thousand thanks, dear mademoiselle,' said I, surveying
with a new emotion of pleasure her beautiful golden hair,
which shone beneath her veil, in the lamp that swung in the
archway above me.
</p>

<p>
She trembled, and said&mdash;
</p>

<p>
'I know not how to begin all I have to say, but the message
comes to you partly from the Chevalier d'Ische, and from the
Prince, his companion.'
</p>

<p>
'De Vaudemont?'
</p>

<p>
'Hush! oh, hush!' she cried, in a stifled voice; 'were that
name heard here I should be destroyed.  Well, monsieur,
they are charmed by your courage and bearing.'
</p>

<p>
'They do me infinite honour, mademoiselle, no less by the
compliment than by the messenger they have chosen; and
this message&mdash;'
</p>

<p>
'Concerns Madame d'Amboise.'
</p>

<p>
'Your mistress?'
</p>

<p>
'My mistress?' reiterated Nicola, with a haughty laugh.
</p>

<p>
'Your friend then.'
</p>

<p>
'Neither my mistress nor my friend; but one day you may
know this enigma.  Well, 'tis of this lady I would speak:
M. Blane, you do not love this woman&mdash;foolish boy, you
cannot love her!'
</p>

<p>
'You call me boy, who are but yourself a girl.'
</p>

<p>
'A girl? true; but a woman in experience.  We begin
life early in this lively city of Paris, my dear M. Blane.
Can you hope to fix such a heart as that of the Countess?'
</p>

<p>
'I dare hope anything,' said I, as all Clara's beauty and
fascination came before me.
</p>

<p>
'Is it worth fixing, a heart that is full of vanity, and finds
no charm in religion, or in virtue?  You cannot raise this
woman to the rank even of a citizen's wife if you married her.'
</p>

<p>
'Married her!' I reiterated; 'by my faith, mademoiselle,'
I added, after a long pause of perplexity, 'you are a bold
little chit to speak thus of the Countess&mdash;'
</p>

<p>
'Of the wretched mistress of Louis XIII.!' said Nicola,
with a gesture of contempt.
</p>

<p>
'Marriage was never thought of, by me, at least; on my
honour, I assure you, Nicola.'
</p>

<p>
''Tis well,' she replied, with singular dignity; 'for by that
act you would lower yourself for ever, and adopt the stigma
of her shame, and of her crimes.'
</p>

<p>
'Crimes! oh, mademoiselle, whither is your energy carrying
you?'
</p>

<p>
'Crimes, or sins, you would soon learn to despise her, while
your own purity would render you an object of hate; your
youth, as contrasted with her riper years, an object of
intolerant jealousy.  Avoid her, M. Blane, and love one who is
young, beautiful, and worthy of you.'
</p>

<p>
'Like yourself, charming Nicola,' said I, gallantly, and
attempting to take her hand; 'the deuce! you are reading me
quite a motherly lecture, little one.'
</p>

<p>
She blushed under her velvet mask, and drew back, for
kindness and earnestness had borne her thus away, and my
perhaps mistimed gallantry offended her.
</p>

<p>
'Do you not perceive how she receives you?  She is always
dressing her hair, or reclining on a couch, her neck and
shoulders bare; her dress a dishabille.  Her eyes are ever
rolling, drooping, or languishing, and she courts compliments
and kisses, which take the rouge from her cheeks; and thus
has she dallied with many before you knew her.  Oh, fie!
M. Blane, you have been both very naughty, and very silly.
There is no love in all this, it is mere allurement.  Pure love,'
she added, in her tremulously gentle voice, 'should be pure
and chaste as an infant's dream.'
</p>

<p>
'May such a love be yours, beautiful Nicola!' said I, struck
by the truth of all she advanced, and charmed by the kindness
of this interesting girl; 'I will ever esteem you as my
kindest friend.'
</p>

<p>
'Money or favour may find you a hundred mistresses, but
never a friend.  Shameless and intriguing, brilliant and subtle,
the Countess seeks only to allure you, as she has allured others,
by studied coquetry, and inviting you by a thousand pretty
ways to love her; but everything on earth passes away, and so,
I trust, will your regard for Madame d'Amboise: her love for
you is but the fancy of an hour, and it will pass, leaving
perhaps shame, and it may be danger or death behind it.'
</p>

<p>
I stood for a minute silent, confounded by the lofty bearing,
impressed by the sense, and piqued by the monitory tone
of this little waiting-maid, whose excessive beauty gave her
the privilege of an empress, and, in truth, she seemed quite
disposed to take it.
</p>

<p>
'Mademoiselle,' said I, 'whether all these admonitions
have come from the reckless chevalier, or are the pure offspring
of your own amiable heart, I shall not be vain enough to
determine; but war will fortunately soon remove me from the
sphere you deem so dangerous, for to remain in it, and treat
the Countess with real or apparent coldness, would destroy me as
readily as if the King discovered her troublesome passion for me.'
</p>

<p>
'Farewell, M. Blane, I am glad that you see your position
so well,' said she, giving me her white hand to kiss;
'farewell! remember all I have said; that I shall ever be your
friend, and as a proof that I am well informed, be prepared
for a journey&mdash;you will leave Paris to-morrow evening!'
</p>

<p>
'To-morrow?'
</p>

<p>
'Farewell!'
</p>

<p>
'But how will you reach the château?'
</p>

<p>
'Antoine awaits me with a fiacre, at the corner of the Rue
de l'Arbre Sec.'
</p>

<p>
'But an escort?'
</p>

<p>
'I have the Chevalier d'Ische, and his friend, disguised as
Swiss musketeers&mdash;adieu!'
</p>

<p>
'Adieu, dear Nicola!' and we separated.
</p>

<p>
'Fool that I was not to get a parting kiss from her!'
thought I, as she tripped away and disappeared.  'In all this
there is some strange mystery; that young girl is no more a
waiting-maid than I am shah of Persia!'
</p>

<p>
At that moment the clock of St. Germain l'Auxerrois struck
twelve, and the Viscount Dundrennan came to take my place
at the postern.
</p>

<p>
'Bravo! a petticoat!' said he, just as Nicola disappeared;
'are the sentinels doubled here at night?  I deemed this the
most dreary post on the Louvre.'
</p>

<p>
I made him an answer in the same jocular vein, and rejoined
my comrades in the guard-room, or salon of the Garde du
Corps Ecossais, and the events of the morrow left me little
time for reflection, and less for inquiry.
</p>

<h3>
CHAPTER XVI.
<br /><br />
WAR.
</h3>

<p>
With dawn next day came an order from M. de la Ferte
Imbault, Colonel-General des Ecossais, in the name of the
King, for the cuirassiers of the Scottish Guard to march that
evening towards Lorraine.  Thus did the whispered tidings of
Nicola become verified!
</p>

<p>
During the long war which desolated Germany by the
armies of Sweden under Gustavus, Horn, and Banner, and
those of the Empire under Tilly, Pappenheim, and the Duke
of Friedland, Cardinal Richelieu had ruled France with a rod
of iron, and, instead of fighting abroad, contented himself by
counteracting the innumerable plots, and rendering abortive
the desperate intrigues formed against his government by
Mary de Medicis or the Duc d'Orleans, until he conceived
the plan of rendering his services as Premier unavoidable, by
involving poor Louis XIII. in a war with the formidable
empire; and acting on a hint, some say, from Marion de
l'Orme, of whom he was secretly enamoured, he resolved to
put his Majesty in possession of Philipsburg, in the fine
frontier-province of Alsace.
</p>

<p>
Exasperated by this wanton and projected usurpation, the
Duke of Lorraine, to whom this territory belonged, placed
himself under the protection of the German emperor.
</p>

<p>
Duke Charles IV. was esteemed by all, as a brave, generous,
and skilful soldier; he had commanded in the Imperial
army at the battle of Prague, and fought the Duke of
Saxe-Weimar and Marshal Gustaf Horn at the battle of Nerling.
He fought for seven hours in his saddle at the attacks on
Poligni and Brissac, and had been more than one hundred
times under fire.  By his first wife, the Princess Nicola of
Lorraine, he had a daughter, Marie-Louise, who was famous
throughout France for her wit, beauty, and accomplishments;
by his second wife he had a son, the Prince de Vaudemont, a
tall youth of eighteen years (in after times the Governor of
Milan), who had already attained a name for adventurous
bravery, and to whom I have twice had the honour of
introducing the reader.
</p>

<p>
Immediately on war being declared against the Empire by
Louis, who did it with great formality, by sending, in the
ancient fashion, a herald-at-arms to Brussels, the Duke of
Lorraine, after victualling and fortifying all his castles, placed
strong garrisons in them, and, at the head of eight hundred
horse and two thousand foot, joined the Emperor.
</p>

<p>
The most Christian King was sorely perplexed by all the turmoil
and warlike bustle in which he found himself involved; and
he spent more time than ever in the silver and blue boudoir of
Madame d'Amboise, or in his dog-kennel at Versailles, while
Richelieu, restless, active, and able, enrolled the Arrière Ban,
and poured five armies into the field, after laying in the lap of
his beautiful monitress the plan of the new campaign, which,
he boasted, would carry the frontiers of France far beyond
the borders of Champagne and Picardy, and all the outlines
of which, the Prince de Vaudemont and the Chevalier d'Ische,
disguised as abbés, or musketeers, had heard freely discussed
in the salons of Paris, and duly transmitted to the Duke and
to the Emperor.
</p>

<p>
The oriflamme was taken from the Abbey of St. Denis; in
a week, the whole country vibrated with war; all the troops
in France were concentrated at five points, and on the march.
</p>

<p>
The first army, under the Dukes d'Angoulême and De la
Force, marched towards Lorraine, and assailed the troops of
Duke Charles, under the terrible John de Wert, and stormed
St. Michel and other places.
</p>

<p>
The second, led by the Duke de Rohan, after fortifying many
places in the Valteline, had a desperate conflict near Bormio,
and defeated Serbellon with the loss of five thousand men.
</p>

<p>
The third, twenty-six thousand strong, led by the Marechal
Duke de Crecqui, entered Italy, laid siege to Valenza, and
stormed the castle of Fontana, when the gallant Marechal
de Thoiras was slain in the assault.
</p>

<p>
The fourth, under the Marechals de Breze and Chatillon
(who had still the garter of Mademoiselle de Guerchi tied to
his sword-arm), entered Picardy, attacked Prince Thomas of
Savoy, and defeated him with the loss of five thousand slain,
taking fifteen hundred men, ninety-five standards, and sixteen
brass guns.
</p>

<p>
The fifth was led by the Cardinal Duke de Lavalette and
Camp-Marechal Sir John Hepburn of Athelstaneford, in
Lothian, who had then the proud pre-eminence of being
esteemed "THE BRAVEST SOLDIER IN THE WORLD;" and it
is of this army alone I shall treat, for, in its ranks, I had the
honour to serve against the veterans of the Empire and the
high-spirited chevaliers of the house of Lorraine.
</p>

<p>
In this army were the ancient regiments of Piedmont,
Normandy, Navarre, and Picardy, styled <i>les vieilles bandes</i>.
The latter corps was six thousand strong, and led by Louis
de Bethune, Duc de Charost.  We had also the younger
corps, La Tour du Pin, Bourbonnais, Auvergne, Belsunce,
Meilly, and the distinguished regiment du Hoi.  Then we
had also the Scottish regiments of Ramsay, Lesly, and
Hepburn; the latter was seven thousand strong; the other
Scots regiments were about five thousand each.  We had
with us a fine train of artillery and a body of cavalry, the
flower of which were the gendarmerie, all clad in coats of
scarlet, richly laced with cuirasses and helmets; the light
horse of the Guard, consisting of two hundred gallant
gentlemen of Navarre, and the hundred cuirassiers of the
Scottish Guard, who were second to none in the world.  Our
foot company remained in Paris to guard the King.  All the
horse had triple-barred cabossets, back and breast pieces, iron
gloves, buff coats, and jack-boots.  The infantry had nearly
laid aside defensive armour, or it was worn by their officers
alone; their uniforms were white, richly faced and laced.
</p>

<p>
We had with us the heavy dragoons of Marechal de Brissac,
commanded by Roger de St. Lacy, for whom the charming
Mademoiselle de Chevreuse had recently obtained a coronet,
with the title of Duc de Bellegarde, and thus he carried her
glove on his helmet.  These dragoons were wont to boast
that they "were the <i>Scots</i> of the French army."
</p>

<p>
In France, I often found the high chivalric bearing of the
noblesse clouded by a lofty imperiousness towards inferiors&mdash;a
bearing unknown to us in Scotland, where all men went
abroad armed, and where the ties of kin and clanship gave the
peer and the peasant a community of name and blood.  In
France, none but men of 'good birth' were permitted to
wear a sword; in Scotland, every man went armed to the
teeth.  On attaining his fifteenth year, the son of the French
noble was ceremoniously conducted to church, accoutred with
belt and sword; his parents preceded him with lighted tapers
to the altar, where the priest, at the offertory, took the weapon
from his boyish hand, and, after a solemn consecration, returned
it to the youth, who did not sheath it until the conclusion of
mass, after which he was entitled to wear it in peace and war,
as a badge of rank and honour.  Such were the ideas impressed
in boyhood on the young French nobles; hence their spirit
was matchless&mdash;their military honour unblemished.
</p>

<p>
It was on a warm and sunny day of spring when we bade
farewell to the gay and beautiful city of Paris, and with all
our trumpets sounding and kettle-drums beating a lively
Scottish air; with our long swords gleaming around the
Cardinal Duke de Lavalette, whose escort we formed, the
hundred cuirassiers of the Garde du Corps Ecossais took the
road to Lorraine, thousands sending their cheers and prayers
after us, while hundreds of pretty girls strewed the way
before us with the early flowers of the summer that was at
hand&mdash;the summer that many of us might never live to see.
</p>

<p>
It was evening when we defiled through the barriers, and I
remembered with surprise how true the warning of the pretty
Nicola had proved.
</p>

<p>
'M. le Cardinal,' asked the King, as the troops marched
from Paris, 'how are all these armies to be victualled?'
</p>

<p>
'That is the enemy's affair, sire&mdash;not ours,' was the reply of
the imperturbable Richelieu.
</p>

<p><br /><br /><br /></p>

<p><a id="chap17"></a></p>

<h3>
CHAPTER XVII.
<br /><br />
THE MARCH.
</h3>

<p>
The army of Lavalette covered all the roads that led towards
Lorraine, and the aspect of the column to which our Scottish
cuirassiers were attached was brilliant and imposing as it
poured through the pastoral province of Champagne, with
corslets and cabossets gleaming in the sun, and all their
bright points glittering, their plumes and banners waving
among the brigades of pikemen and musketeers, dragoons,
artillery, baggage, and trains of pontooneers and petardiers.
</p>

<p>
After traversing a spacious plain we crossed the Marne at
Meaux, which made a march of thirty-two miles.  This was
severe enough for heavily-armed cavalry, so we halted all
next day and heard Father Gilbert Blackhall, a Scottish
Jesuit, preach in the cathedral of St. Stephen.  Continuing
our march we passed Colomiers (which was soon after to be
made a peerage for Henry of Orleans, Duke of Longoville)
and La Ferte sous Jouarre, which lies in a narrow valley
twelve miles eastward of it.  We crossed the river by an old
wooden bridge, and our captain, the Marquis de Gordon,
took up his quarters in the ancient castle, which had been
burned by the Huguenots in 1562, in those days when religion
and rapine, slaughter and conversion went hand in hand;
and ere long our trumpets made the old ruined streets of
Sezanne&mdash;which was still half in ashes, just as the Huguenots
had left it in the days of Charles IX.&mdash;resound as they blew
the cavalquet in the market-place.  The town is prettily
situated between two small rivers, and having a good market
for corn, wine, and wood, formed a convenient halting-place, and
here we remained for three days by the advice of our
Marechal de Logis.
</p>

<p>
We carried little baggage.  Our horses were well inured
to fatigue, and had been kept constantly in condition by
drilling, marching, and galloping at full speed by squadrons.
On these occasions rider and horse were always fully armed
and accoutred; thus all our movements became characterized
by unusual spirit and velocity.
</p>

<p>
I thought frequently of the Countess, from whom I was
now completely separated; but being beyond the sphere and
fascination of her presence, my regret was not very poignant.
Then the softer and gentle image of Nicola would come
before me.
</p>

<p>
'Pshaw!' thought I; 'a little intriguing waiting-maid&mdash;absurd!'
</p>

<p>
On the march towards Sezanne we passed hundreds of
French stragglers, who had sunk under fatigue and lay by the
wayside; but never a Scottish musketeer of Ramsay, Hepburn,
or Leely left his colours, though their regiments composed
half our force of infantry; but our Scots have naturally the
gift of enduring fatigue, and the habit of marching&mdash;for it is a
habit which other soldiers have generally to acquire.
</p>

<p>
'Well,' said the Viscount Dundrennan, shrugging his
shoulders, as we received our billets on the bourgeoisie; 'I
suppose, M. le Maire, you have neither a theatre or other
place of entertainment here?'
</p>

<p>
'At this distance from Paris, M. le Gend'arme, I should
think not! but,' he added, with a twinkle in his eye&mdash;for this
paunchy magistrate and wine-merchant was an old Huguenot&mdash;'there
is a pretty convent of Ursulines on the height yonder.'
</p>

<p>
'Yes, monsieur.'
</p>

<p>
'A convent?'
</p>

<p>
'A charming little place, monsieur; the walls are covered
with roses&mdash;'
</p>

<p>
'Ah! to conceal the broken bottles and iron spikes below,
I suppose.'
</p>

<p>
'Yes, monsieur,' said the Maire, grinning and bowing.
</p>

<p>
'Say <i>monseigneur</i>, M. le Maire; you are addressing a
Viscount,' said the Chevalier Livingstone; and the magistrate
bowed thrice to his red garters.
</p>

<p>
'There is a piece of the true cross there,' he added, with
his impudent smile, 'in a golden shrine that cost a thousand
louis d'ors, and the abbess is only four-and-twenty years old,
while there is not a novice over sixteen.'
</p>

<p>
'Tête Dieu!' exclaimed the Chevalier; 'do you say so?'
</p>

<p>
'Not one over sixteen, messieurs, and all high born and
beautiful.'
</p>

<p>
'By the devil's death, I shall visit them,' said Dundrennan,
putting his foot in his stirrup; 'I must see all these pretty
ones, hap what may.'
</p>

<p>
'But how?' I asked.
</p>

<p>
'Viscount, you are mad!' exclaimed Cheyne and others.
</p>

<p>
'How so, gentlemen?' said he, mounting; 'I am the
grandson of a commendator.'
</p>

<p>
'The devil!' exclaimed the Chevalier, laughing; 'dost
think the nuns will esteem you the more for that?'
</p>

<p>
'But how will you enter?' I asked.
</p>

<p>
''Tis very simple.  I fall sick at the gate or am thrown
from my horse, and the sympathizing abbess, the kind nuns and
pretty little novices, carry me in; they remove my helmet&mdash;they
bathe my temples with perfumes, and with their own
soft hands, and thus the fortress is taken by stratagem.'
</p>

<p>
'Beware, Viscount, I beseech you,' said I; 'such pranks
may bring you to the Bastille.'
</p>

<p>
'Viscount, you are incorrigible!' said Sir Quentin Home.
</p>

<p>
'Ten crowns to one, you don't get entrance,' said the
reckless Chevalier Livingstone.
</p>

<p>
'You shall see, gentlemen&mdash;my ten crowns are won,' cried
the madcap Viscount, as he galloped away with all his
brilliant accoutrements flashing in the sun; and the waggish
maire rubbed his hands with glee, as he saw him cross the
bridge and ascend the height on which the sequestered convent
stood.
</p>

<p>
In an hour be rejoined us, looking rather grave and a little
ashamed of himself and of his prank.
</p>

<p>
'How about our little bet?' asked Livingstone.
</p>

<p>
'You have lost, Chevalier,' said Dundrennan; 'so order
dinner for us all at the hotel.'
</p>

<p>
He had fully succeeded; but the nuns proved to be all old
women; there was not a novice in the house, and the abbess
was in her sixty-seventh year.  She was a lady of noble and
magnificent presence, and on discovering her visitor to be a
gentleman of the Scottish Guard, announced herself to be
Mary Stuart&mdash;that mysterious nun who was then so well
known in France as the Mother of Resurrection, and who was
openly affirmed to be the daughter of the wicked Earl of
Bothwell, and the unhappy Mary Queen of Scots&mdash;born in
Lochleven, and kidnapped to France&mdash;a descent also claimed
by an eminent divine in Scotland.
</p>

<p>
She had received the Viscount kindly, gracefully, and told
him who she was supposed to be; and he returned to us, in a
more sober mood than we had seen him in for many a day.
</p>

<p>
During our halt, the convent parlour was thronged by the
gentlemen of the Scottish forces; and our illustrious
Camp-Marechal Hepburn presented to the abbess a valuable gold
medal, which, in the German wars, he had torn from the neck
of the terrible Count Pappenheim, the hero of a hundred
wounds.
</p>

<p>
Weary with marching in all our harness, half choked
by the spring dust, that rolled along the roads of Upper
Champagne, under the feet of so many thousand infantry, and
the wheels of many powder-waggons, baggage-wains, and field-pieces,
just as the sun was setting, we gladly halted one evening,
in the little town of La Fere Champenoise, and resigned
our horses to our grooms, servants, or pages.
</p>

<p>
As we rambled along the streets in search of refreshment,
the welcome voice of a tapster, shouting to passengers in the
old fashion, drew us towards a tavern or hostelry.
</p>

<p>
'Messieurs,' he continued to cry, 'we have here good wine
and good oats! will you have a chopin for yourself and a
measure for your charger? enter, messieurs, enter!'
</p>

<p>
This tavern was styled the <i>Count of Champagne</i>, from its
sign-board, which bore an imaginary head of that personage
in a barbed helmet of the middle ages; and from the
circumstance of the quaint old house having been a residence of
Theobauld V., last Count of Champagne and Brie;
consequently our tavern was quite historical, and at least four
hundred years old.

<h3>
CHAPTER XVIII.
<br /><br />
THE TWO ABBÉS.
</h3>

<p>
Dundrennan, Sir Quintin Home, Raynold Cheyne and I,
entered the common hall, or room of the tavern, and after
bowing politely to two abbés who were seated in a corner
conversing over a stoup of French wine, and reading the
columns of the 'Mercury,' we ordered dinner.
</p>

<p>
'A poor tavern this,' said Sir Quentin, surveying the old
gloomy room and worm-eaten furniture.
</p>

<p>
'True; but our swords are sheathed in leather just
now&mdash;not crimson velvet,' said the Viscount, pithily.
</p>

<p>
'That ride from Mailly to-day has given me an appetite,'
said Cheyne; 'dinner&mdash;dinner, quick!'
</p>

<p>
'And jovial stoups of your wine of champagne all round,'
added Sir Quentin.
</p>

<p>
'What the deuce, my Laird of Redden!' exclaimed the
Viscount, 'thy purse actually rings with the sound of metal;
hast thou inherited a fortune?'
</p>

<p>
'Or been upon the highway?' added Cheyne, in the same
tone of banter.
</p>

<p>
'I have been overmuch upon the highway since I rid
myself of yonder English captain in the bounds of Berwick,'
replied the Baronet, with a grim smile; 'since that
unfortunate day, my purse has usually been the lightest thing
about me.'
</p>

<p>
'Except thy heart, gallant Home,' added Dundrennan.
</p>

<p>
'Viscount, I thank you.'
</p>

<p>
'And yet, Sir Quentin,' said I, 'rumour avers that the
fair Mademoiselle de Chevreuse views you with favour, and
we all know that she has eighty thousand francs per
annum.'
</p>

<p>
'Eighty thousand!  Ah, Heaven! think of that!' sighed
the poor Baronet; 'if she were tenderly inclined, mademoiselle
might make me the happiest man in France, and her paternal
coat would look very well when quartered with the lion
rampant of Home <i>argent</i> armed and langued <i>gules</i>.'
</p>

<p>
'But think of De Guerchi, whose heart might break,
though Chatillon wears her garter.'
</p>

<p>
'Pshaw! is not one pretty girl as good as another,
Viscount?'
</p>

<p>
'If their purses be of the same weight.'
</p>

<p>
'Of course, Viscount.  Ouf! how mercenary we have
become among these Parisians.  But beware, gentlemen, we
have a couple of abbés here,' said Home, lowering his voice,
and to mention my name with that of Mademoiselle de
Chevreuse in their hearing might bring upon me the eyes
of monseigneur the Archbishop of Paris; and there are
certain devilish contrivances in France known as <i>lettres
de cachet</i>, which lead to an unpleasant place called the
Bastille.'
</p>

<p>
'Ten devils!' said the Viscount; 'don't think of them.'
</p>

<p>
'The archbishop was a capital swordsman when he was
known simply as the little Abbé Gondi; but I have no wish
to measure swords or strength with him now.'
</p>

<p>
'Here comes the dinner at last,' said Dundrennan, flinging
aside his belt and gauntlets; 'bravo, maitre d'hôtel! are all
these fine children yours?'
</p>

<p>
'Tush, Viscount, don't ask unpleasant questions,' said
Cheyne, still in his spirit of banter; 'they are, at least, the
children of his wife, Madame la Comtesse de Champagne, our
generous lady of the signboard.'
</p>

<p>
And so, amid gaiety and laughter, heedless of the two
reverend abbés who sat in the corner, we sat down to dinner.
</p>

<p>
It was then the custom in France, when one was invited to
dinner, to send a servant with one's knife, fork, and spoon, as
these things were never provided for guests.  We all produced
our apparatus from our pockets, and attacked the viands, as we
would have done the enemy.
</p>

<p>
The two abbés, who had been quite silent since we entered
the room, now began to talk while our jaws were otherwise
employed; but as they invariably became silent when any of
us spoke, and sat in shadow, with their faces turned from us,
I conceived, without knowing why, an instinctive mistrust of
their character, and watched them narrowly.  One was dark
in complexion; the other fair, and ten years younger in face
and manner; but the knowledge that the costume of an <i>abbé</i>
was then the usual attire, or disguise of French gentlemen
when travelling, rendered me wary of drawing attention to
their presence, or to their conversation, the scraps of which
were somewhat to the following effect.
</p>

<p>
'She is very lovely, with her violet eyes and golden hair,'
said the younger abbé; 'Marie Louise herself is not superior
to her!'
</p>

<p>
'Ah, you know her, then&mdash;this Madame de Charost?' asked
the elder and darker abbé.
</p>

<p>
'Too well for my own peace; but you smile.'
</p>

<p>
'She is one of the most faithful wives in Paris.'
</p>

<p>
'To her husband?'
</p>

<p>
'No, to his dear friend&mdash;&mdash;'
</p>

<p>
'Diable! who is he?'
</p>

<p>
'Ah, your hand wanders to where your sword should be.
There is great wisdom in consigning these tools to the tapster,
when we visit a tavern.'
</p>

<p>
'But who is this friend?'
</p>

<p>
'The new camp-master of the regiment de Normandie.'
</p>

<p>
'The Marquis de Toneins, son of the Duke de la Force?'
</p>

<p>
'Yes.'
</p>

<p>
'Good,' said the fair abbé, angrily; 'I shall remember
that when we meet again.  Ah, poor little Charost&mdash;she is
indeed an innocent!'
</p>

<p>
'Yes, a pretty innocent, who sings comic operas, and reads
romances in Lent,' whispered the older abbé, in his bantering
tone.
</p>

<p>
Deeming this conversation about the gay and divorced
Duchess of Charost rather odd in its tenor to be maintained
by two churchmen, I now gave all my attention to
them.
</p>

<p>
'Mon Dieu! and so you actually fought a duel with this
young spark De Toneins?' exclaimed the dark abbé.
</p>

<p>
'Yes, because duelling being strictly forbidden in the
camp, we fought about everything; even the peccadilloes of
the girls at the Hôtel d'Argent, or about who was the best
hand with cards, a case of pistols, anything in short.  But he
fairly ran me through the body.'
</p>

<p>
'I think you have a luck that way.  Ouf! after this, I
would have paid a priest to curse him.'
</p>

<p>
'Bah!' replied the fair abbé, with a bitter smile, 'I can
do it cheaper myself.'
</p>

<p>
'True,' replied the other, and while drumming with his
fingers on the table, hummed half-abstractedly&mdash;
</p>

<p class="poem">
  'Fille d'un simple pelletier,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Elle était gentillette;<br />
  Robert en galant chevalier<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vint lui conter fleurette.'<br />
</p>

<p class="noindent">
This song, together with the voice, stirred an immediate
chord in my memory; and while pretending to examine
certain pictures of farriers' shops, riding-houses, and Dutch
market-places, by Albert Kuyp, with which the room was
decorated, I drew near the two reverend abbés, and observed
them more particularly; and despite their perukes, in imitation
of the inventor, the absurd Abbé la Rivière, I recognised
in the elder and darker, the devil-may-care Chevalier Raoul
d'Ische; and in the younger and fair-haired, the Prince of
Vaudemont, the son of that Duke of Lorraine, whose
territories we were about to enter.
</p>

<p>
Perplexity and astonishment at the cool daring of these two
cavaliers kept me silent; and they continued to converse
without observing me.
</p>

<p>
'You are right,' said the Prince, in reply to some remark
of the Chevalier; 'the risks run by Marie Louise, whose beauty
and delicacy render her so suspiciously attractive, are a source
of great unhappiness to me.'
</p>

<p>
'But her presence in Paris is as necessary to us, as twenty
thousand men upon the frontier,' replied the Chevalier, in the
same low, guarded tone.  'The Countess&mdash;'
</p>

<p>
'What Countess?'
</p>

<p>
'Madame d'Amboise.  You have read and destroyed her
last despatch from Paris, I hope?'
</p>

<p>
'Yes, Chevalier; and deposited the answer.'
</p>

<p>
'Where, M. le Prince?'
</p>

<p>
'In the place agreed upon; the old oak at the fountain on
the highway; 'tis, as usual, in ciphers, which she of course
alone can read, having the key.  Moreover&mdash;'
</p>

<p>
'Hush, <i>M. l'Abbé</i>&mdash;we are observed.'
</p>

<p>
'Then let us retire.'
</p>

<p>
They rose abruptly and withdrew; but this unguarded
conversation convinced me more than ever that the famous
Princess Marie Louise of Lorraine was living concealed in
Paris; that the mistress of the King was betraying both him
and Richelieu, and, being a Lorrainer, was in the interest of
Duke Charles and his people.
</p>

<p>
'Comrades, excuse me for a minute,' said I, and followed
these Lorrainers, whom I found in the act of receiving their
swords from the tapster, and mounting their horses, which
were strong and active nags, accoutred with valises and
holster-pistols.
</p>

<p>
'Monseigneur,' said I, saluting the Prince, 'I have
discovered you; indeed I must have been blind or mad, had I
failed to do so.'
</p>

<p>
'Hola! upon my soul, 'tis our very good friend, M. Blane
of Garde Ecossais!' said the Chevalier, with as much surprise
as if he had not been observing me for an hour past.  'Well,
sir?'
</p>

<p>
'Retire&mdash;leave our vicinity; this espionnage is not honourable,
and you trust me too far.'
</p>

<p>
'Ah! you begin to threaten us&mdash;eh?'
</p>

<p>
'If, in one hour hence, I find you near our cantonments,
by Heaven, messieurs, I will denounce you both to the Duke
de la Lavalette!'
</p>

<p>
'Mort de tout les diables! he <i>does</i> threaten us, Chevalier,'
said the Prince, haughtily.  'Very well, M. Blane, I command
my father's troops at Bitche, the first town upon the Alsatian
frontier; you will find me there in other guise than that of an
abbé.'
</p>

<p>
'And if you pass Bitche with bones unbroken, and come
the length of La Mothe,' added the Chevalier, 'you will find
<i>me</i> there, with my helmet on, my young soldier.  I shall then
be at the head of Duke Charles's old steel crabs, whose claws
are sharp enough, believe me&mdash;and so till then, adieu, my dear
Garde Ecossais.'
</p>

<p>
'Adieu, messieurs,' said I, and we separated with cold
salutes.
</p>

<p>
They galloped away, and I rejoined my three companions,
who were singing vociferously an old Scottish rant, and
becoming more jolly than ever, over the sparkling wine of
Champagne.

<h3>
CHAPTER XIX.
<br /><br />
THE CAMPAIGN IN ALSACE.
</h3>

<p>
Our next day's march brought us to Vitry le Francois, a
walled town, built of wood.  Here we crossed the Marne;
the cavalry by a ford, the infantry and artillery by boats and
floats; and here a singular episode occurred.
</p>

<p>
As the soldiers of the seventh battalion of Camp-Marechal
Hepburn's regiment of Scots were crossing, a boat full of them
overturned; a musketeer, in the confusion and dismay of the
moment, grasped a woman who sat next him, believing she
was his wife, and swam ashore with her.  On reaching the
bank, he turned joyfully to embrace her; when, lo! he found
that he had saved the wife of another, and left his own, with
her babe, to perish in the river, which swept most of these
unfortunates away, to drown among the boats and barges, mud
and slime, below the ford.  The poor soldier, in the first
impulse of his grief and despair, threw himself into the stream
again, and being heavily armed and accoutred, sank like a
stone, though the Laird of Tushielaw, one of our cuirassiers,
made a brave attempt to save him.
</p>

<p>
We were now in Lorraine&mdash;the country of the enemy, and
our troops began to plunder in every direction; yet we saw
little fighting for some days.  As for the plunder, it was the
fashion of war in France.
</p>

<p>
'A little legitimate contribution,' the Chevalier Livingstone
called it; 'M. le Cardinal would have us to pay for
everything here, as we would in the Rue St. Honoré!'
</p>

<p>
On entering Toul, which until 1550 had been a free city of
the German empire, the hundred cuirassiers were the
advanced guard of the army; and here I was detailed as one of
a foraging-party under the old Marechal de Logis.  As the
people treated us scurvily, we foraged with such enthusiasm,
that with cocked pistols we ransacked bureaux and boxes, as
well as barns and pantries; and some of our men realised a
very pretty sum.  The aspect of our Marechal de Logis, dark,
weather-beaten, scaled all over in an old suit of James V.'s
time, and whiskered like a seahorse, made the poor Lorrainers
yield up the best of everything in the name of king Louis.
</p>

<p>
'Always take plunder and provender when they are to be
had,' was his maxim; 'for in war, we know not when an evil
day may come.  By Jove, sirs! when I was besieged in Ulm,
with old Velt-Marechal Ruthven, I ate more rats than any
old tom-cat; for provisions were short, and the wine being
bad, it always flew to my head; because it is an empty
place, and clear of brain, you young fellows may think; but
your own will be light enough when you have soldiered as
long as old Patrick Gordon.  Forward, my foragers!&mdash;hack
and manger and spare not!'
</p>

<p>
On leaving the fertile valley, where the quaint old city of
Toul clusters by the bank of the blue Moselle, surrounded by
a chain of hills, that are covered to their summits by teeming
vineyards, green foliage, and fertility&mdash;on leaving it, we took
the road direct to Strasbourg and the Rhine, every night
engirding our camp and cantonments with strong out-picquets,
as we drew nearer the vicinity of the foe.
</p>

<p>
On the 16th of March, we passed close to the strongly-fortified
city of Nanci, the crooked and narrow, quaint and dark
streets of which stand in the centre of a beautiful plain; and
we Scots thought it worth a month's pay to see old Ramsay's
regiment, five thousand strong, marching through its thoroughfares
in column, with all their drums and fifes making them
echo to the 'East Neuk o' Fife,' the liveliest of all our
quick-steps.
</p>

<p>
We had now marched two hundred and thirty miles from
Paris.
</p>

<p>
The French out-picquet, on the road to our front, alarmed
the whole army one night, by firing at a mysterious object
which hovered before them in the dark.  A party of M. de
Brissac's dragoons were ordered out to patrol; but as they
always required a long time to grease and blacken their boots
and mustachios, Dundrennan, Home, Livingstone, and I galloped
forward to ascertain the cause of alarm; and discovered
an old cow, riddled with bullets, lying on the roadway.  By
this time the whole army were under arms, thinking the
Imperialists were upon us; and there was no small amount of
laughter and grumbling at those young soldiers&mdash;<i>vieilles
mustaches</i>&mdash;who caused such a disturbance.  The cow we gave to
our fourrier-major, and her collops were all simmering in the
camp-kettles, long before our trumpets blew <i>à cheval</i> again.
</p>

<p>
As it neither suited our service, nor the policy of the time,
to be absent from church, we were marched to the great
cathedral, where we saw mass celebrated with great pomp
and ceremony.  Many of our reformed Scots shrugged their
shoulders, and knitted their brows; but the Marquis de
Gordon, who came of a Catholic house, whispered to me,&mdash;
</p>

<p>
'Is it not a sad thing, M. Blane&mdash;sad to me, at least&mdash;to
see a hundred gentlemen of the Scottish Guard mere idle
spectators here&mdash;strangers before that altar, for which so many
of their fathers bent the knee in peace, and laid down their
lives in war?'
</p>

<p>
'My mother's house were Lollards of Kyle,' said I.
</p>

<p>
Vic, with its old ruined castle of the twelfth century; the
marshy plain of Marsal; the little town of Dieuse, and the
sedgy banks of the Sielle, were all rapidly passed, without a
shot being exchanged; and now we approached the land of
strong castles and barrier-towns, as we entered Alsace, a
German circle of the Upper Rhine, which was not ceded to
France until 1648, prior to which year it belonged to the
house of Swabia, who were styled Dukes of Alsace.  Here,
at a village in which we were quartered, I first tasted that
vintage, peculiar to the province, named the stroh, or straw
wine; and here we found, that which proved much less pleasant,
the bravest of Duke Charles's troops, combined with
some of the chosen and hardy lanzknechts of the Empire,
garrisoning all the fortresses that lay between us and the
far-famed Rhine.
</p>

<p>
Cardinal de Lavalette, who commanded us, was a son of the
famous Duc d'Epernon, and was particularly an adherent and
friend of Cardinal Richelieu.  With Sir John Hepburn, he
had under his baton, another Camp-Marechal, the Viscount de
Turenne, whose military genius and brilliant valour rendered
him almost the equal of that great cavalier whom a cannon-shot
at the siege of Zaberne was to send prematurely to his
grave.
</p>

<p>
The general of the Imperialists was Mathias Count Gallas,
a native of Trent, whose reputation and long career of severe
and successful service, rendered him a formidable antagonist
to the young Cardinal, whose army was to act in conjunction
with the Swedes under the Duke of Saxe-Weimar, and to add
Alsace to the new conquests of France, whose frontier
Richelieu had sworn should be the Rhine.
</p>

<p>
Though Count Gallas had been guilty of great cruelty in
Saxony, the brilliance of his achievements in Bohemia, the
skill with which he invested Lauff, and pushed the siege of
Mantua, and the greatness of mind he displayed in releasing
old Count Thurn, because he would not see a brave enemy
perish on the scaffold, together with his fine order of battle at
Nordlingen, had gained him such a reputation, that the veteran
General Leganez, exclaimed,
</p>

<p>
'The best officer in the world might learn something
from Gallas!'
</p>

<p>
His head-quarters were now at Worms, from whence he sent
out strong detachments to ravage all the country and capture
the places still held by the Swedes, before they could be joined
by their new allies the French.  He stormed Keizar-Loutar;
invested Deux-Ponts; and after forcing Count Mansfeldt's
lines before Mentz, threw supplies into the city, and thus
stood matters when our army halted on the frontier of
Alsace.
</p>

<p>
Having heard from our spies that a thousand of Gallas'
cavalry horses were at grass in a verdant hollow near Ingwieler,
a little town on the Motter, a tributary of the Rhine, I
conceived the idea of decoying, and bringing them all to
Lavalette's head-quarters.  Full of ardour and enthusiasm, I
burned for an opportunity to distinguish myself; and accustomed
as I had been to border picqueering and foraging, it
seemed an expedition adapted to my skill and capacity.  Sir
Quentin Home and Lord Dundrennan (they were a pair of
inseparables), Raynold Cheyne of Dundargle, the Chevalier,
Tushielaw, and another spirit equally reckless, insisted on
accompanying me; and on obtaining permission from the
Marquis our captain, and from Camp-Marechal Hepburn, we
prepared at once to put our scheme in force&mdash;quietly and
deliberately as we would have done in other days to cross the
English frontier, and drive home the fatted beeves of the
western wardenrie.
</p>

<p>
'War is full of rules for practice Mr. Blane,' said the
Marquis, as he gave me leave; 'yet it is without any fixed
principle; so in this bold stratagem, I trust entirely to your
perspicacity, your discernment, and bravery.'
</p>

<p>
I bowed, and with a beating heart hurried to my tent.  I
was most anxious that this attempt should be successful, for the
eyes of all in the camp were on us, and on me in particular.
Our rendezvous was the tent of the Marquis.
</p>

<p>
'I shall be punctual,' said Cheyne, when I explained my
plans.
</p>

<p>
'Thanks, Raynold, and you Viscount, and Home?'
</p>

<p>
'We will be punctual as night or death,' said the wild
Laird of Redden with his grim smile as we separated.
</p>

<p>
By my direction seven suits of clothes like those worn by
the Croats of Gallas were procured for us.  Under their tight
jackets we wore our back and breast plates.  We invested our
nether-persons in wide red pantaloons, which ended in ankle-boots;
we put on thick fur caps, and arming ourselves with
crooked sabres, daggers, and six pairs of loaded pistols each,
(two in the holsters and four in the girdle,) after practising to
whoop and to scream, we found ourselves turned into very
respectable Croats of whom the Ban himself might have been
proud.  We chose active little horses, and after meeting at
the tent of the Marquis, departed from the camp at sunset,
followed, about a mile in our rear, by fifty of the light horse,
who were led by the young Marquis de Toneins, and were to
cover our retreat, and if necessary aid the attempt.

<h3>
CHAPTER XX.
<br /><br />
THE DECOY.
</h3>

<p>
A ride of some miles brought us to a valley overshadowed
by steep black mountains.  The darkness had set in, and a
waning moon, diminished to a crescent, peeped coldly above
the shoulder of a rocky hill, pale, sharp, and keen.  Over this
grassy hollow, which was less than a mile in extent, we could
see the chargers to the number of a thousand, at least, quietly
at grass; and just as the troop of light horse concealed
themselves in a thicket, a fire was seen to flash and burn brightly
on the brow of the rocky hill.  This marked the post of the
Imperialist guard who had charge of the steeds in the valley.
</p>

<p>
Scattered among them we could distinguish a number of the
enemy's dragoons in foraging dress.
</p>

<p>
Riding furiously with short stirrups, and in that wild and
tumultuous fashion peculiar to the Croatian troopers, we
succeeded in deceiving and passing two advanced sentinels; and
on making a circuit of the little valley, we got between the
scattered horses and the guard which protected them.
</p>

<p>
'Now, gentlemen, now is our time to drive the prey!' said
I, in a loud whisper.
</p>

<p>
'Hah, Viscount,' cried Home, whose eyes flashed with
excitement, ''tis a touch of the old times this!'
</p>

<p>
'True, Sir Quentin,' added young Scott of Tushielaw;
'and in gude faith, sirs, I could almost fancy this hollow a
scroggy glen on the southern slope of the Cheviots; yonder
gorge, by which we have come, the Pass of Carter-bar; and
all these Austrian nags, a herd of well-fed English kye.'
</p>

<p>
'Hush, sirs,' said I; 'be wary, be wary, and remember my
directions.'
</p>

<p>
'Of course,' said Dundrennan; 'I never trust horses or
women, as both are apt to grow skittish on occasions; so wary
we must be.'
</p>

<p>
'Let us scatter now,' said I; 'and when I fire a pistol,
dash on and drive the prey.'
</p>

<p>
'Bravo!'
</p>

<p>
'Hurrah!'
</p>

<p>
'Vivat Rex!' were the exclamations of my six reckless
comrades, all of whom were well acquainted with what they
had to do, and drew off about twenty yards from each other.
The moment I fired my pistol, an immediate commotion took
place among the horses; all those that were lying on the
ground sprang to their feet; and all that were grazing lifted
their heads, pricked up their ears, and prepared to fly <i>from</i> the
direction in which the sound came.
</p>

<p>
Now with loud shouts, firing all our pistols (we could give
forty-two shots amongst us), and brandishing our crooked
sabres, we rode furiously to the right and left in a half circle,
but always advancing however, and driving before us the
startled herd of horses, which all rushed tumultuously like a
living flood, with their heads and hind legs in the air, towards
the lower end of the valley, the route we wished them to
pursue.  Thus, in a moment, the whole mass were in motion,
and we rode along with them, decoying and driving them on,
treading down and trampling under hoof the few dismounted
men whom we had seen scattered among them; some of these
we pistolled or sabred as we spurred furiously forward,
alternately leading or driving, and hallooing madly; for to us it
seemed the wildest of sport, smiting with the flat, or pricking
with the point of our sabres any nag that seemed disposed to
loiter, or not to follow the leader, for Tushielaw rode in front,
guiding all the fugitives towards our camp.
</p>

<p>
The Imperial Guard at the upper end of the valley were
bewildered, and fired recklessly into the dark; while an
Austrian sentinel, who placed himself right in the centre of our
path, with his cocked musket nearly shot Lord Dundrennan,
who by one stroke clove his Spanish beaver, with the iron calotte
which he wore under it, and slew him in a moment.
</p>

<p>
The whole stratagem and seizure were most successful; and
without receiving a scar among us, we decoyed the entire
herd of horses into the narrow gorge between the mountains.
Sir Quentin Home was in extasy at the success of our scheme;
and his aspect in the Croatian dress was peculiarly wild as he
came furiously up to my side.  He had the reins of his bridle
in his teeth, together with his dagger; and guiding his horse
by both knees, levelled in each hand a cocked pistol.
</p>

<p>
The chevalier kept his ramrod in his teeth, to reload his
pistols more rapidly; and now when we drew up for this
purpose, and to recover breath, we were fully two miles from
the valley of Ingweiler.  Now the light horse of M. de
Toneins wheeled up from the thicket, and assisted us to hem
the horses more completely into a narrow way between hedges
and walls, where, after half-an-hour's anxious delay, the whole
suffered themselves to be taken without difficulty, and we
threw over their heads the bridoons and stall-collars or halters
with which we were amply provided.  These were afterwards
buckled together, linking all the horses into little troops; and
these riderless ranks were each led by a trooper in the centre.
</p>

<p>
In an incredibly short space of time all were ready, not a
horse was lost; and we departed at full speed for the camp.
This affair was rather disastrous for the enemy; for among
the horses at grass were several which belonged to a foraging
party.  These, by the alarm or example of others, broke from
their picquets, threw down both riders and trusses, and, by this,
more than fifty men were trampled under foot, as we afterwards
read in the <i>Gallobelgicus</i>.
</p>

<p>
The whole decoy was ably and skilfully managed; but
we had just effected our retreat in time, for the Austrian
cuirassier regiments of Goetz and Gordon, with six pieces of
cannon, despatched by Count Gallas, had almost overtaken us
when we reached our camp on the frontier of Alsace.  But this
was not the only service I had the honour to perform before
we advanced further into that province.
</p>

<p>
Hearing that the enemy had stored up a quantity of provisions
at Phalsbourg, a little town that lies at the foot of a
mountain on the borders of Lorraine, and gives a title to a
principality, I offered, if twenty of Brissac's dragoons were
lent to me, to make a dash at the provender, of which my
comrades of the Guard were rather short.  This I also
accomplished, and, at the sword's point, procured them fifteen
waggons of dry and green forage; so that we once more had
the Marechal de Logis' allowance of twenty pounds of hay,
ten pounds of oats, and five pounds of straw per diem for each
cuirassier.
</p>

<p>
Moreover, in this night's onfall, we spiked two brass
field-pieces, blew up the tumbrils, slew seven of the Emperor's
own regiment of Pelardiers, and partly burned the town.
</p>

<p>
These two exploits procured me the special notice of the
Duke de Lavalette, and of one whose admiration I valued
much more&mdash;my countryman, the great Sir John Hepburn of
Athelstaneford, on whom the eyes of all France and Sweden
were turning, as being in all probability the successor of his
late master, Gustavus Adolphus, in the arduous struggle with
the Empire; a hope in which they were doomed to be fatally
disappointed by his premature death.
</p>

<p>
He offered me a lieutenancy in his regiment; but, being
urged by Dundrennan, and flattered by the Marquis our
captain, I thanked him, and begged leave to remain with my
comrades of the Guard.

<h3>
CHAPTER XXI.
<br /><br />
A CHARGE OF THE SCOTTISH GUARD.
</h3>

<p>
We came in sight of Bitche on the morning of the 25th
March, which was still in that year (1634), <i>New Year's-day</i>
in England; though the governments of Scotland and of
France altered that festival to the 1st of January in 1599,
during the reigns of James VI. and Charles IX.
</p>

<p>
We were with the advanced guard of cavalry, which consisted
of the dragoons of Marshal Brissac and the light horse
of the Guard, two hundred Navarrese chevaliers, the pride of
Henry the Great; and as the Marquis de Gordon, who
commanded the whole, understood that a strong force lay in
Bitche, he halted, reconnoitred, and bivouacked as the night
had set in and our main body had not yet come up.
</p>

<p>
We slept overnight in our cloaks, under a chill dew, at the
heads of our horses, which remained fully accoutred, unbitted,
and ready for action at a moment's notice&mdash;a fortunate
precaution; for with the first pale streak of dawn, when all were
weary, cold, and shivering, I was roused by the bracing
cry of&mdash;
</p>

<p>
'Aux armes! à cheval!' and <i>to horse!</i> blew all our
trumpets, while the long roll of the 'Scottish march,' beaten
sharply on the drum, rang along the far-extended lines of
Hepburn, Lesly, and Ramsay.  And now a body of imperial
cavalry, the old-whiskered reitres, and German lanzknechts
of the Empire, accoutred in black iron and buff leather, with
lance, arquebuse, and espadone, appeared in dark masses and
in solid squadron, about a thousand strong, on the narrow
road that lay direct to Bitche.
</p>

<p>
The latter, a little town on the Alsatian frontier, which
gave the title of count to a gentleman of the house of
Lorraine, stands upon a rock, and was deemed impregnable.
Beyond it rose the sombre masses of the Vosges mountains,
around the peaks of which the morning mist was wreathing
and curling upward&mdash;golden, white, and purple in the rising
sun; and on the highest towers of the old and dun-coloured
citadel waved the white flag, bearing the black eagle of the
Empire, and the yellow banner with the three blue wings of
Lorraine.
</p>

<p>
As the artillery had not yet come up, the cavalry were to
open a passage for the infantry through these Imperialists;
and to us was reserved the honour of attacking the enemy's
cavalry if our comrades failed, for it has been a maxim in war
since the days of Julius Cæsar to keep the best troops in
reserve.
</p>

<p>
With loud shouts of 'Navarre!  Navarre!' the glittering
light horse of the Guard swept forward to the attack, in two
heavy squadrons of fifty chevaliers abreast, with the royal
standard, three fleur-de-lis or in a field <i>azure</i>, advanced
above their bright helmets, their swords uplifted, and their
white ostrich plumes streaming behind them.  There was a
lowering of lances along the German line; a flashing of
pistols; a fierce shock, and rolling of men and horses upon
the green turf or dusty road; and, with a shout of rage and
defiance, the chevaliers of Navarre recoiled before the enemy,
leaving thirty of their number dead or writhing on the ground,
while the heavy dragoons of Brissac, led by Roger de St. Lacy,
the gallant Duc de Bellegarde, advanced by double troops in
dense order from a trot to full speed, and with the old <i>cri de
guerre</i>&mdash;
</p>

<p>
'Montjoie and St. Denis for France!' as all their brandished
sword-blades flashed against the morning sun.
</p>

<p>
A dreadful conflict took place, for Brissac's dragoons were
heavy men, accustomed to fight on foot or on horseback; and
in the melée we beheld with fierce impatience how helmets
were cloven, buff coats pierced and shred, while heads and
weapons, men, standards, and horses swayed or went down
into that armed and living sea which struggled in the
mountain gorge&mdash;went down to rise no more!
</p>

<p>
Bellegarde was wounded by a splendidly-accoutred young
imperial colonel, who wore a coat of steel lined with scarlet
velvet, with crimson hose, a black plume in his helmet, and
the eagle on his breast; and who, throughout this conflict, on
which the morning sun shone with unclouded brilliance, was
conspicuous alike by the glitter of his equipment and the
rashness of his courage.  Yells, shrieks, groans, the clashing
of swords and the sharp ringing report of pistols echoed
between the hills.  Men were crawling out from the press
covered with bruises, blood, and dust; wounded horses were
hopping about on three legs, and others, in the throes of
death, rolled madly from side to side, kicking furiously all
who came near them.  This roused all our fire; and, with
something like a shout of fierce joy and anger mingled, we
saw the dark dragoons of Marshal Brissac give way at last
before the solid German ranks.
</p>

<p>
'Now, gentlemen, <i>it is our turn</i>!' exclaimed (he handsome
young Marquis&mdash;the heir of Huntly&mdash;as he brandished his
sword, and his dark eyes flashed with the fire of his nature,
while he spurred to the front with a glove in his helmet&mdash;the
gift of Lady Anne Campbell, of Argyle, whom he afterwards
married.  'Montjoie and Saint Denis!  France&mdash;France and
Scotland, for ever! trot&mdash;gallop&mdash;comrades&mdash;les Gardes
Ecossais, follow me&mdash;CHARGE!'
</p>

<p>
Every lip was set; every cheek was flushed; every eye
was sparkling as I gazed along the ranks of the chosen
hundred cuirassiers, when the voice of our leader and the
shrill twang of the trumpet bade us move, and when the
contagious ardour ran from man to man and heart to heart
along that Scottish line&mdash;Scottish in name and blood, and
heart and soul&mdash;second to none in pride of race and chivalry.
</p>

<p>
On, on we progressed from a trot to a gallop, and the ranks
grew denser, holster to holster and boot to boot, as the horses
closed upon each other; and like a stream of lightning, the
hundred guardsmen poured forward in all their brilliant
trappings, with uplifted swords and St. Andrew's cross waving
on the wind, as Sir Archibald Douglas, of Heriotmuir, held it
aloft in his stirrup.  On, on we went, and though they were
eight to one, the dark ranks of the reitres and lancers quailed
and wavered before us!
</p>

<p>
Headlong we rode at them, and plunged into the vapour
made by the smoke of firearms mingled with the morning
mist.  This murky cloud seemed full of helmeted heads, of
gauntleted hands, the bright points of levelled pikes, of
brandished swords, and waving standards; while the air was
laden with cries, tumultuous sounds, and the heavy odour of
gunpowder.
</p>

<p>
Now&mdash;now we are within arm's length of them&mdash;
</p>

<p>
There was a mighty shock as rearing horses and shrieking
men went down on all sides of us, but we burst right through
the heart of the foe, breaking their close array of horses' heads
and cuirassed breasts; the dead and the dying marking our
track as on right and left we hewed them down.
</p>

<p>
Raynold Cheyne, Scott of Tushielaw, Dundrennan, and the
Chevalier, were all fighting like the peers of Charlemagne,
and each performed many acts of heroism.  The Master of
St. Monance, son of James Sandilands, Lord Abercrombie of
Abercrombie, was struck on the breast by a shell, while riding
next me.  It was thrown from the citadel, and in exploding,
blew his jaw off, but, singular to say, injured no one else.
He gave a strange, half-smothered cry as his horse turned and
fled; he was dragged by the stirrup down a steep ravine, and
we never saw him more.
</p>

<p>
Dagobert bore me bravely; but, bewildered by the fury of
our advance and the concussion of the encounter, I knew not
for a moment where I was, whether on earth on in upper air,
so great was the din around me, until a sharp ringing blow on
my helmet recalled my energies with all the instinct of
self-preservation, and I found myself thrust somewhat out of the
press, and opposed hand to hand to the young colonel&mdash;he in
steel and scarlet velvet&mdash;whose valour we had observed for
some time, and in whom I now recognised my Parisian
acquaintance of the Place de la Grève, of the Château
d'Amtoise, and latterly the abbé of the tavern at
Sezanne&mdash;Monseigneur the Prince of Vaudemont&mdash;the son and heir of
Lorraine!
</p>

<p>
For a moment my confusion nearly destroyed me.
</p>

<p>
'Ha!' he exclaimed, thrusting at me furiously; 'welcome
to this meeting, M. Blane.  Mordieu! you have kept your
appointment well; now I am no longer M. l'Abbé of the
tavern, but a reitre who will skewer you on his sword like a
pigeon on a spit.'
</p>

<p>
'Your present guise becomes you better than the garb of a
spy,' said I, dealing him a blow which cleft a gilded
passguard off his cuirass.
</p>

<p>
'Tudieu, my fine fellow!  I find that I must kill you,
then&mdash;here is cold steel for a hot heart!  Lorraine, Lorraine,
and down with the Fleur-de-lis!' he exclaimed, pressing
fiercely on me; but the war-cry brought so many other
horsemen and swords into the melée, that we almost
immediately, and perhaps fortunately, separated.
</p>

<p>
Our veteran Marechal de Logis was fighting valiantly in
the front rank to capture a standard, the bearer of which, a
richly accoutred cavalier, struck the sword from his hand, and
was about to slay the fine old man, when I drove up his blade,
and dashed Dagobert almost on his hind legs between them.
The Imperialist was a finished swordsman; but perceiving
that he was weary, I resolved to force his guard.  He could
barely cover himself on the side opposed to me, so pressing
forward I struck the fort of my sword furiously on his blade,
and thus succeeded in giving him a cut on the right shoulder;
and while taking care to receive his sword, as it came forward,
on the cross-bar of my hilt, I ran him through the body,
and wrenched away the standard.  The blood poured over
my glove and pommel as he fell from his saddle, and there
was an end of my poor Lorrainer, for the time at least.
</p>

<p>
He was the Count de Bitche, colonel of petardiers under
Duke Charles&mdash;the same infamous Count who had abducted
and strangled the beautiful Countess of Lutzelstein, so I have
no reason to deplore very much, that my lunge through his
Lordship's ribs proved so successful.
</p>

<p>
The standard I had taken bore the three wings of Lorraine,
and was borne by the Prince of Vaudemont's horse.
</p>

<p>
'Arthur Blane,' said the old Marechal de Logis, 'I thank
you for that timely succour and good service.  I am getting
old now; a man, like a drum-head, cannot last for ever&mdash;both
wear out in time; but I have seen a day when no man
in Europe could have stricken a sword from Patrick Gordon's
hand.'
</p>

<p>
The veteran had provided himself with another weapon, and
was spurring on once more; but now, the rout of the enemy's
cavalry was general, and they fled at full speed, goading and
goring their horses' flanks, as they retired past Bitche, towards
the stronger citadel of La Mothe, which lay some miles
distant.
</p>

<p>
For two miles we&mdash;the cuirassiers of the Scottish Guard&mdash;together
with the Navarrese light horse, and the dragoons of
Brissac, followed them, killing and capturing at every step of
the way, though the valiant young Prince of Vaudemont made
no less than nine attempts to rally them and to repulse us.
</p>

<p>
'Well, my Lord Dundrennan,' said the Marquis, as they
galloped side by side; 'how felt you in your first charge
to-day?'
</p>

<p>
'A glorious disregard alike of death and fear!' was the
proud reply; 'and I am sure that such was the feeling of us
all.'
</p>

<p>
The rout of so superior a body of horse was entirely
attributed, by the Duc de Lavalette, to the skill and fury
with which we advanced; for cavalry when charging, should
always trot gently for about a hundred paces, and thereafter
increase their speed until they attain a full and furious gallop,
closing to the croup when within twenty paces of the enemy;
but such was the celerity with which our hundred cuirassiers
advanced, that we charged fully two thousand paces, boot to
boot, without breaking; and it may fairly be admitted, that
when horsemen have achieved this point of perfection they
would ride through a stone rampart&mdash;they are fit for anything.
</p>

<p>
The field, or rather the roadway where this skirmish took
place, was strewed with dead and wounded.  After the former
were stripped and the baggage plundered, one could get any
article of attire for a twentieth part of its value.
</p>

<p>
A Parmese dagger, for a franc.
</p>

<p>
A velvet coat laced with gold, for five francs.
</p>

<p>
A sword, a hat and feathers, for a pot of stroh wine.
</p>

<p>
Our petardiers blew up the barrier gates of Bitche, which
were feebly defended by the town guard and a few old
soldiers armed with partizans.  The castle was stormed by
the light horse, who were dismounted for that service; and
who, in their anxiety to wipe out the disgrace of their late
repulse, acted with great cruelty, 'sparing,' as the Marquis
de Toneins told us, 'none but the ugly and the poor.'  We
blew up the magazines, spiked the guns, and set the town on
fire; and as the old song says,
</p>

<p class="poem">
  'When churches and houses blazed all in a flame,<br />
  With <i>tan-ta-ra-ra</i>, away we all came!'<br />
</p>

<p><a id="chap22"></a></p>

<h3>
CHAPTER XXII.
<br /><br />
A DANGEROUS BOAST.
</h3>

<p>
'In the poor Master of St. Monance we have lost a gallant
comrade,' said I, as we began our march the next morning.
</p>

<p>
'He fell in battle, Blanerne,' said the Marquis; 'well&mdash;a
Scottish gentleman&mdash;a cadet of the house of Calder&mdash;has
nothing more to ask.'
</p>

<p>
After receiving the sacrament and twenty rounds of ball
cartridge, we advanced towards La Mothe, the operations
before which were full of chivalrous little episodes.
</p>

<p>
Like Bitche, La Mothe, in the bailiewick of Bassignie, had
the reputation of being impregnable, as it crowned the crest
of a mountain of hard rock, which overlooked all the
neighbouring eminences.  A tributary of the Maese flowed
at its foot.  The town had but one gate, which was strongly
fortified and guarded by flankers, mounted with brass cannon.
It was filled with troops, who, like the inhabitants, were
faithful to the Duke of Lorraine; and his Bailiff of Bassignie,
the Chevalier Raoul d'Ische, commanded them with vigour
and resolution, in which he was ably seconded by the Prince
of Vaudemont, who had now joined him with all his fugitive
cavalry.  Thus we anticipated great trouble in convincing
these Lorrainers that their native country should become the
property of king Louis.
</p>

<p>
That no time might be lost in reducing the place, as the
army of Count Gallas was only one hundred and fifty miles
distant, Camp-Marechal Hepburn, to whom the siege was
intrusted, enclosed the town and mountain on all sides.  He
formed seven batteries of thirty guns against it, and laid five
mines under the walls; but our chief difficulty was a low
bastion which lay before the entrance.  It was mounted by
twenty heavy guns, and swept the whole ascent for nearly a
mile.  This formidable barrier was named, after the Duke's
daughter, the Bastion de Louise.  It worked us infinite
mischief, and though intrenched before it, with all the skill of
the great trench-master the Chevalier Antoine de Ville, the
Scottish infantry of Ramsay and Lesly suffered severely, losing
in killed and wounded nearly fifty men daily.
</p>

<p>
The wetness of the season increased our discomfort in our
tents, and the sharp cold midnight rain that poured and
pattered on the canvas walls often penetrated them, while the
vibration of the tent pole and straining of the cordage
made one dream at times of being at sea, and often at night,
when asleep and muffled in my cloak, I saw, in fancy, the
black and rocky Rinns of Galloway&mdash;my native coast&mdash;rise
before me, with the wild waves of the western sea dashing on
their flinty brows.
</p>

<p>
The operations before La Mothe were of a very harassing
description.  While the Cardinal de Lavalette continued his
march towards the Rhine, Hepburn, with the Marquis, the
Viscomtes of Turenne and Arpajou, the Colonels Lesly and
Ramsay, pressed on the siege, which the indefatigable Chevalier
d'Ische protracted for nearly five months, until besiegers
and besieged were alike weary and exasperated.  Vast numbers
of our men were buried under earthen banks and parapets
by the exploding mines, the bursting of bombs, and by the
cannonading; while our trenches were nightly scoured by
pike and arquebuse, for the Chevalier and the Prince were
reckless and courageous to a fault.
</p>

<p>
The Marquis de Toneins, a youth who had seen more
battles and sieges than he could count years&mdash;the idol of
Anne of Austria's maids of honour&mdash;made our sixth attempt
to storm the Bastion de Louise; but was repulsed with unusual
slaughter, and lost nearly all his men by their being hurled
over the rocks into the river below.  De Toneins was wounded
by the Prince of Vaudemont, who had singled him out during
the assault; and when he was borne bleeding into my tent,
the remarkable conversation I had overheard at Sezanne,
concerning the divorced Duchess de Charost, recurred to me;
when de Toneins fell wounded, Raoul d'Ische tried hard to
despatch him by a pike-thrust.
</p>

<p>
Turenne, the young Marquis's rival alike in love and war,
next day made the seventh assault on the same bastion, with
the same success, though ably seconded by the Chevalier
Ramsay, Knight of St. Lazarus, with his company of the
regiment of Hepburn.
</p>

<p>
During these disastrous attacks, we, with the other cavalry,
were employed in scouring the whole province of Alsace, of
which we had taken full possession in the name of Louis
XIII., who required only La Mothe and one or two other
places to complete his conquest.  The firing was incessant.
Cannon, mortars, and bombardes, muskets and arquebuses,
environed the walls the livelong day with fire and smoke;
and our fellows returned the compliment with the same
amiable inventions; and in bulwark, trench, and battery,
familiarity with danger soon bred contempt alike for shot
and shell.  But the fire maintained from the Bastion de
Louise, from daybreak to sunset, was the most terrible and
destructive that we had to encounter; and the extinction of
this battery, before we could reach the gate (our only avenue
to the town) was imperative.
</p>

<p>
I conceived the idea of achieving this, by nailing up the
cannon; and having spoken of it, in the hearing of several
officers, one night, as we sat under the shelter of a haystack,
drinking stroh wine out of cups and jars, my observations
reached the ears of Sir John Hepburn, who sent for me, and
with one of his quiet smiles which rather piqued me, he said,
</p>

<p>
'What is this I hear, Mr. Blane&mdash;you have conceived
a project to silence that devil of a bastion which is so
destructive to us?'
</p>

<p>
I bowed, and he continued with the same smile.
</p>

<p>
'I am glad to hear of it, for, by Jove! if we stay here
another month, our horses' bones will stand through their skins,
like the ribs of a gridiron, as we have foraged and eaten up
the whole of Alsace!  And now for the project?'
</p>

<p>
I reddened with vexation and confusion, for my words were
heedlessly spoken, though seriously conveyed by some meddling
gabbler; and as I stood before this well-tried soldier,
who had fought in the Scoto-Bohemian bands at Fleura,
commanded an army on the Vistula, stormed Frankfort and
Marienbourg, and who had led the final charge of the Scots
brigades at Leipzig, I trembled to be deemed by him an
empty boaster, and so replied&mdash;
</p>

<p>
'It is true, Sir John, that some such idea has occurred to me.'
</p>

<p>
'But this Chevalier d'Ische has boasted that never a Scot
shall show his moustache within pistol-shot of him.'
</p>

<p>
'I have been nearer to him twice than I am now to you, Sir
John; and he has had good reason to remember my vicinity.'
</p>

<p>
'Ah!  And where were these meetings?'
</p>

<p>
'First, in the Place de la Grève, where I passed my rapier
fairly through him.'
</p>

<p>
'And secondly?'
</p>

<p>
'At Sezanne; but I am bound in honour not to say how.'
</p>

<p>
'But your project?' said Hepburn, stroking his moustache.
</p>

<p>
'Since my name has been mentioned in connection with this
affair,' said I, with a bitterness which I had some trouble in
concealing, 'I will undertake to destroy yonder battery, or
perish in the attempt.
</p>

<p>
'You will!' he exclaimed with joy.
</p>

<p>
'To the brave all things are possible.'
</p>

<p>
'Turenne, de Toneins, Arpajou, Ramsay, and I, all
consider ourselves pretty brave fellows; yet you see, my boy, we
have all failed in turn.'
</p>

<p>
'But your example has given me double courage.'
</p>

<p>
'I thank you, Blane.  'Tis spoken like your father's son!
But how many men do you require?'
</p>

<p>
'None.'
</p>

<p>
'None!' he reiterated.
</p>

<p>
'I shall go alone on this hazardous enterprise.'
</p>

<p>
'And you dare hope to achieve this&mdash;to spike these
obnoxious guns?'
</p>

<p>
'Yes; I hope to do anything I make up my mind to, from
foraying a hen-roost to firing a city.'
</p>

<p>
'Bravo, my boy! you should have been with me in Poland
and Bavaria!'
</p>

<p>
With a heart full of hope, ardour, and anxiety, I left his
presence to ponder over my undertaking, and on reflection,
the desperation of it crushed and appalled me.  It seemed as
if I had suddenly made up my mind to perish&mdash;to sacrifice
life and existence for a bubble, when even, with all the
chances and mischances of war, I might have many years to
live, and much to achieve&mdash;and though mentioned last, not
thought of least, the restoration of my ruined house and
humbled family to their ancient name and fame at home.
</p>

<p>
'Blane, when compared with this project of yours, the
ideas of Don Quixote were superlative wisdom!' said the
Marquis of Gordon gloomily, when I rejoined the Garde du
Corps.
</p>

<p>
'But my honour is pledged.'
</p>

<p>
'True,' he replied; 'and the honour of the Garde du Corps
Ecossais too, my dear fellow, for the eyes of the whole army
will be on you now.  But, doubtless, you have some fair
maid of Galloway at home, whose heart will leap when she
hears of this; or perhaps some pretty one in gay Paris, who,
whether you fall or succeed, will read with joy the triumph
of your bravery in the "Mercure Française."'
</p>

<p>
'Alas, no!  Marquis&mdash;neither in France nor at home in the
dear land I never more may see, have I one to weep for me.'
</p>

<p>
'Tudieu! that's odd.'
</p>

<p>
'None,' I added sadly, 'except&mdash;'
</p>

<p>
'Ah! there is an exception!'
</p>

<p>
I sighed&mdash;but I thought only of the Countess for an
instant&mdash;and then of the golden-haired Nicola.
</p>

<p>
'Strange!' I muttered, 'that even in this hour of perplexity
and anxiety that girl's face comes before me!'
</p>

<p>
My resolutions were soon formed.  At sunset I crept as
close as I dared to the bastion, and with a telescope examined
it from every point; but the bourgeoisie who manned it soon
discovered me; a salute was fired in honour of my appearance;
the bullets of their arquebuses fell thick around me in
a shower as I crept back, and escaped to mature my plans and
perhaps to&mdash;pray.

<h3>
CHAPTER XXIII.
<br /><br />
THE BASTION DE LOUISE.
</h3>

<p>
Dundrennan, Sir Quentin Home, the Chevalier Livingstone,
and other gallant gentlemen of the troop were anxious to
share with me the honour of this perilous enterprise; but,
aware of the danger&mdash;the almost certain death&mdash;to be incurred,
I peremptorily declined all assistance, and resolved to
achieve the deed alone, or pay the penalty of my own folly.
</p>

<p>
The firing languished as usual after sunset, and before
nightfall had completely ceased.  I clasped on my cuirass and
gorget, buttoning over them the doublet of a Lorrainer who
had been killed last night in the trenches.  It was of dark
cloth, faced and trimmed with the colours of duke Charles.
I put on a light helmet, stuck four pistols in my girdle, and
leaving my sword, took only a dagger.  I had a light ladder,
ten feet long; a rope, a hammer, and a pocketful of spike
nails; and with this apparatus, when the miners were at work,
and the out-guards or covering parties sleeping in their
blankets, capôtes, or rocquelaures, I issued from the camp,
and leaving all behind, advanced on my solitary and
desperate enterprise towards the Bastion de Louise.
</p>

<p>
Frequently I paused to listen; but no sound came from the
town, the ramparts and church spire of which&mdash;for it had but
one&mdash;towered above me in the dark and moonless sky, across
which the clouds were hurrying in black and broken masses.
</p>

<p>
As I crept on my mission, strange thoughts of home and of
other times <i>would</i> force themselves vividly upon me; and I
remembered the green breezy braes, and the grassy dells,
where the mountain runnel brawled under the broad-leaved
water docks or the purple heather, and bright yellow broom,
where as a boy I had played among the lambs, and gathered
the white daisy and the golden buttercup, or watched the
white smoke curling from the huge hall chimney of my father's
old grey tower.  To-night I might be slain&mdash;slain far, far
away; and I thought of the quiet green grave where my
father and mother slept so peacefully side to side in the old
kirkyard at Glenkens, and a wild, deep wish rose from my
heart to my lips that I was at rest beside them, and away
from the selfish hurry of life and all the horror of war!
</p>

<p>
Anon came hope of success, and prouder thoughts arose
within me, and grasping my dagger, I continued to creep
stealthily forward.
</p>

<p>
Rearward, I heard the grating sound of the shovel and
pickaxe in the trenches, as the sappers of the Chevalier de
Ville replaced the gabions, or batted down the earthen banks,
which the cannonade of the past day had disturbed.  Perhaps
a lantern might throw out a momentary gleam; but even
momentary was too much; for then a lurid flash would break
from the citadel, lighting all the sky with instantaneous
redness, and a ball would whiz over my head towards the miner's
lamp; or a shell would curve high in air, distinctly traceable,
as it soared from the mouth of the mortar and sunk downward
to its destination, by the fuse that flamed upward through its
touch-hole, and now the terrible Bastion de Louise arose
before me in massive strength, with its row of twenty brass
guns frowning en-barbette, over the slope of the rampart.
</p>

<p>
Anxiety and shame filled my heart on finding that the
bastion was full of men; sentinels, too, were on the parapet,
as their outline, with helmet and arquebuse, were distinctly
visible.  For me to proceed was impossible, as the least sound
might draw a volley towards the spot where I was lurking;
but to return to the camp, merely to report that I had failed,
and that my attempt, however rash and gallant, had proved a
mere bravado, was more than I could think of, or endure with
patience.
</p>

<p>
Creeping on, I came close to a stockade, which rose at the
angle of forty-five degrees to the height of five feet in front of
the ditch before the bastion, some shrubs and bushes grew at
its base, and among these I lay close; so close, indeed, that I
heard the words of command given, as the Lorrainers marched
into the town, and, to my inexpressible relief, left none in the
bastion, save the four sentinels.  Four men were more easily
to be met than four hundred; but even by this reckoning how
was I to dispose of them?  To pistol them all in succession
was next to an impossibility, situated as I was; moreover, the
discharge of a single shot would suffice to rouse the whole
town, and man the walls from flank to flank in five minutes.
</p>

<p>
The darkness had increased, and fortunately for me the
night bore every indication of becoming a stormy one.  A
high wind swept the side of the mountain; the river hurried
over its bed of rocks with a hoarse brawl towards the Maese;
and the gusty blasts, as they came in fierce and fitful squalls,
piled the clouds in black and inky masses above La Mothe,
the black outline of which&mdash;tower, spire, and rampart&mdash;stood
forth black and sharply, at times as broad glares of sheet
lightning flashed across the sky, seeming to whiten the summits
of the distant hills, and to tip with fire the dewy leaves of the
shrubs that covered all the rocky ground; and now, to my
joy, came a broad, blinding, and united torrent of rain, falling
slowly but surely, as if it would last for hours.
</p>

<p>
The frightful and oppressive stench of the partially-buried
slain that lay before the stockade was not the least of my
troubles; for in some of the places I had crept over, the men
of Ramsay and of Hepburn were interred only a foot deep;
and where the rain had washed away the soil, their toes and
fingers, and more horrible still, their white skulls and ghastly
teeth, were visible among the soft mould and sprouting
grass!
</p>

<p>
I crept through a small aperture formed by some chance
bullet in the stockade, and drawing my ladder after me reached
the edge of the fosse that engirt the bastion; and now I could
perceive that the dark figures of the four sentinels had
disappeared; they had withdrawn to their stone turrets, one of
which terminated each angle of the ravelin.
</p>

<p>
Still crawling serpentwise, I dropped my ladder into the
fosse, (which on my side was only twelve feet deep,) and
descending crossed it, over splinters of fallen masonry and
exploded shells.  Placing the ladder against the sloping face
of the bastion, which was sixteen feet in height, I easily
reached the stone cordon that girdled it, and from thence, all
wet and slippery though it was, by the drenching rain, I swung
myself up to the cope; but not daring to cross it erect, I crept
inwards, keeping close alongside the nearest cannon, and at
length stood <i>within</i> the parapet of the dreaded Bastion de
Louise!
</p>

<p>
My heart leaped within me!
</p>

<p>
The rain was still pouring downward or aslant as the gusts
blew it; not a sentinel was visible; each was in his box, or
stone turret, within a pistol shot of me, but the bellowing
wind, and the rain that smoked along the parapet, and bubbled
in the gorged gutters, concealed every sound, and with my
spike nails and hammer (the face of which I had carefully
covered with thick leather to preclude the faintest sound of
<i>clinking</i>) I proceeded at once to remove the leaden aprons from
the touch-holes, and to complete my dangerous task, by
crawling from gun to gun, and keeping my figure as much as
possible below the upper line of the parapet&mdash;a precaution
almost needless, as the darkness was so great.
</p>

<p>
I had spiked four culverins, when suddenly a light flashed
along the wet and shining pavement, and two dark figures
drew near me.  My pulses stood still&mdash;but relinquishing my
hammer for a pistol, with the resolution to sell my poor life
dearly and desperately, I shrank close under a gun-carriage
and lay <i>en perdu</i>, while two officers, cloaked and helmeted,
evidently making a nightly round, passed within a yard of me,
responding to the challenges of the various sentinels.  One
was undoubtedly the Prince of Vaudemont; and the other,
who bore the lantern, I discovered in a moment to be my
acquaintance the Chevalier d'Ische.
</p>

<p>
'So M. le Governeur, you will only let him have this place
as a pile of ruins,' said the Prince as they passed; but I did
not hear the reply.
</p>

<p>
'Good,' said the Prince again, 'but the vivres&mdash;'
</p>

<p>
'O&mdash;the rats are good&mdash;the cats most excellent&mdash;we have
no want of provision,' responded the gay Chevalier, and as
they turned the angle of the works and disappeared, despite
the rain and discomfort of the night, I heard him singing his
invariable song&mdash;
</p>

<p class="poem">
  'O vive le fils d'Harlette!<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Normands,<br />
  Vive le fils d'Harlette!'<br />
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
I resumed my task, and in less than five minutes, by twenty
blows of my heavy hammer, had driven twenty spike nails
home to the head, firmly and securely, in the vents of as
many pieces of cannon, unheard and unseen; though I
expected every instant to hear a shout, or receive a shot from
the dark recesses of the angle-turrets.  Had the night been
fine or fair, this feat had never been accomplished; but I
should have perished in attempting it.  I now descended the
parapet, and from the projecting cordon reached my ladder,
recrossed the fosse, and on ascending the opposite side, left my
means of ascent, together with my hammer, as a legacy to the
enemy.  The stockade was easily surmounted from the inside,
and half blinded by the pouring rain and by the excitement of
my own feelings, I rushed over the half-buried dead, and back
towards the trenches to report that the Bastion de Louise had
been deprived of its teeth.
</p>

<p>
As the reward of my enterprise, I narrowly escaped being
shot by my friends.  On hurrying towards our lines, a voice
crying <i>qui va là?</i> from the angle of a trench, and the rattle
of a musket made me pause; but being breathless by my race
down hill, I was unable to speak.  I had stumbled upon a
trench guard of the young Marquis de Tonein's regiment.
</p>

<p>
'Qui va là?' shouted the sentinel again.  'Stand, monsieur,
and deliver the parole.'
</p>

<p>
'<i>Saint Louis.</i>'
</p>

<p>
'Bon&mdash;good,' he replied, shouldering his musket.
</p>

<p>
'The countersign, if you please?' said I.
</p>

<p>
'<i>Paris.</i>'
</p>

<p>
'Thank you, friend musketeer.'
</p>

<p>
'<i>Saint Louis et Paris</i>.  Bon! a thousand thanks, Monsieur
Ecossais.  A rash fellow would have fired at once on any
man rushing thus from the enemy's lines.  And now, brave
comrade, what of the Bastion de Louise?'
</p>

<p>
'It is fangless now.'
</p>

<p>
'Mordieu! you have accomplished your task.  O monsieur,
that I were you! we shall dance a cotillon there in the
morning.'
</p>

<p>
All blackened, muddy, and drenched, I hurried to the
quarters of Sir John Hepburn, whom I found ensconced in
the lower story of a ruined windmill, with the Viscounts
Dundrennan, de Turenne, and Arpajou; the Marquis de
Toneins; and Colonels Ramsay and Lesly, some sleeping, some
smoking and drinking Rhenish and stroh wine by the light of
a stable lantern; and to them I reported my success.  The
tall and stately Hepburn embraced me, all soiled as I was.
He made me drain his cup filled with wine, and taking from
his own breast the cross of St. Lazare, said&mdash;
</p>

<p>
'Wear this for me; and be assured, Arthur Blane, that on
my recommendation king Louis will more than confirm the
gift.  I here proclaim you the premier cuirassier of the
Scottish guard!'
</p>

<p>
The first man who invented the plan of nailing up cannon,
by driving an iron spike into the touch-hole, was Caspar
Vimercalus, a soldier of Bremen, who thus destroyed the
artillery of Sigismund Malatesta.  There have been many
contrivances suggested to force out nails that were thus
inserted, but none have been found of general use.

CHAPTER XXIV.
<br /><br />
MONTJOIE ST. DENIS!
</h3>

<p>
Next morning, before daybreak, preparations were made to
capture the disarmed bastion, and to effect a lodgment under
the walls and town gates.
</p>

<p>
The rain and wind had passed away, and the keen, bright
stars were looking out of the blue sky; but there was no
moon, and half-an-hour before dawn, three hundred chosen
men of the Scottish regiments of Hepburn, Ramsay, and
Lesly&mdash;one hundred from each&mdash;mustered in front of their
wet tents, to storm the Bastion de Louise.  They were all
volunteers, lightly accoutred, and supplied each with the
<i>chardon de fer</i>, or crampiron, which was strapped over the shoe
by means of a buckle.  Previous to this invention, stormers
used to take one shoe off, to prevent them from slipping on a
rampart.
</p>

<p>
The Vicomtes de Turenne and Arpajou, neither of whom
had completed his twenty-third year, and Sir John Hepburn,
led the assault.  With them were twenty dismounted cuirassiers
of the Scottish guard, of whom I was one, armed with
partizans, and carrying daggers and pistols in our girdles.
</p>

<p>
'Forward, gentlemen, quickly and in silence,' said Sir
John, as we marched to the front, and began the ascent of the
mountain; 'to-night we shall sup in La Mothe, and drink to
the fair maids of old Scotland in the best Burgundy of Duke
Charles.'
</p>

<p>
Followed by a strong covering column, under Colonel
Ramsay, we left the trenches in our rear, and almost without
a sound advanced over the wet and slippery ground I had so
lately traversed twice, until we were within musket-shot of
the walls, when the unfortunate explosion of an arquebuse, as
a soldier stumbled and fell, gave an alarm, and in a moment
after, we heard the drums beating in La Mothe; curving and
sparkling, the rockets hissed aloft in fiery circles as the walls
were manned and the Lorrainers stood by their guns in the
Bastion de Louise, and opened, at random, a fire of small arms
upon us.
</p>

<p>
A brilliant flash, with a deep, hoarse, booming sound, from
the town barrier, made me stoop instinctively, as a cannon
shot passed over my head, and tore to pieces a poor pikeman in
my rear.  It struck him right in the breast; a portion of his
body hit Lord Dundrennan with such force that he could
scarcely breathe for some minutes after; but on we hurried
with all speed, anxious to come to blows at a shorter distance.
</p>

<p>
The coolness of the brilliant Marquis de Gordon, as we
advanced, was somewhat amusing.  Drawing off his gauntlet,
he said to a captain of Ramsay's corps&mdash;
</p>

<p>
'Forbes, I'll trouble you for a pinch of snuff.'
</p>

<p>
The captain was about to comply, when a second flash
broke from the town rampart, and a ball cut him in two.
</p>

<p>
'Zounds!' said the Marquis, 'M. le Vicomte Arpajou, I
shall trouble you, for poor friend and his box have gone
together.  Comrade,' he added, to a man who fell with a
shriek, as his left leg was shattered by a musket-shot, 'why
are you making such an outcry? it will not cure you; but
here is my silk scarf, 'tis at your service as a bandage.'
</p>

<p>
'Bravo, comrades and gentlemen!' exclaimed Sir John
Hepburn, brandishing his sword; 'here we are at the foot of
the glacis!'
</p>

<p>
Over it, the arquebuses à croc were pouring death and
havock among us; but the destruction of their cannon had
evidently dismayed the Lorrainers, and deprived them of all
confidence.  Still their fire was so steady and severe, directed
as it was by the dawn which was breaking behind us, and
clearly defined our figures, that we wavered now at the edge
of the fosse, after surmounting and destroying the stockade
by axes, hammers, and crowbars, and there was an
unmistakeable reluctance to advance, while the stormers fell
fast on every hand, and we heard the tumultuous cheers of
Ramsay's covering column, which was pressing on our rear.
</p>

<p>
Hepburn held aloft his purse.
</p>

<p>
'Forward, comrades!' he cried; 'a thousand francs to the
first with me in the bastion.'
</p>

<p>
Not a man among us stirred; he grew deathly pale, but
still continued to brandish his sword, while the bullets sawed
all the turf about him.
</p>

<p>
'Come on, sirs&mdash;my old Scots musketeers and gentlemen of
the guard&mdash;Dundrennan, Douglas, Blane, and Bruce, follow
me!'
</p>

<p>
'Hepburn, you have insulted us all by this offer of money,'
said the Marquis of Gordon.
</p>

<p>
'My cross of Mont Carmel, in the King's name then,'
</p>

<p>
he replied, with a flushing cheek, as he tore it from his breast
and flung it into the fosse.*
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p class="footnote">
* An incident almost similar occurred with the Irish Brigade at
Havannah.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
'Hurrah!' burst from every tongue.
</p>

<p>
'Montjoie St. Denis!' cried Turenne.
</p>

<p>
'France&mdash;France and Scotland for ever!' added the
Vicomte Arpajou.
</p>

<p>
And with wild shouts that rent the air of the calm morning
sky, we rushed into the fosse, and planting our echelles against
the bastion, ascended, fighting hand-to-hand, and firing our
pistols into the faces of the foe, as we grappled for life and
death on the summit, and forced a passage in, with the loss of
eighty brave Scottish soldiers.
</p>

<p>
Sir John was the first man on the rampart; the second, and
consequently the winner of the cross of Mont Carmel, was
one of his own private musketeers, a poor gentleman from the
braes of Angus, who rose to be count and general of cavalry
in the French army.
</p>

<p>
The Lorrainers were driven furiously back; but a savage
conflict ensued with them between the bastion and the town-gate;
and there, in the cold gray light of the morning, were
Scottish musketeers and German pikemen, chevaliers in
brilliant plate-armour, gentlemen of our Garde du Corps, and
those of Lorraine, with the lean and famished bourgeoisie of
the town, in their black and battered harness, all mingled in
one wild melée of whirling swords and clubbed muskets,
as they closed up round the tall figure of Hepburn on one
side, and the fierce and energetic Raoul d'Ische on the other.
</p>

<p>
Side by side two of our cuirassiers had almost hewed a
passage to the shattered barrier, the archway of which was
encumbered by paths of dead and dying, and behind these the
musketeers and pistoleers were nestling, and plying fast their
shot.
</p>

<p>
These two were young Sir Robert Bruce of Blairhall, and
old Sir Archibald Douglas of Heriotmuir, who had lost his
helmet, and whose silver tresses were glittering in the dewy air.
</p>

<p>
'You have the precedence here by age,' said Blairhall,
saluting him with his bloody rapier; 'my brave friend, lead on!'
</p>

<p>
'Nay,' said Sir Archibald, lowering also his blade, 'do thou
advance, my brave boy; where a Bruce leads, a Douglas may
be proud to <i>follow</i>!'
</p>

<p>
Fatal courtesy!  It was scarcely exchanged, ere the first
was run through by a pike, and a gigantic bourgeois brained
the latter by the ampoulette of his clubbed musket.  The
poor old baronet's brains flew over me, but I pistolled his
destroyer, who fell prone into that gory puddle where the two
bravest gentlemen of the Garde du Corps Ecossais were
lying side by side.
</p>

<p>
In a moment afterwards I found myself opposed to the
Chevalier d'Ische, hand-to-hand, and so closely, that our
weapons were engaged up to the very hilt, and being
encumbered by a wounded man, who grasped my right leg in his
death agony, I received a severe cut on the right cheek.
</p>

<p>
'Ah, thou diabolical Scot! at last I have thee!' said the
Chevalier, grinding his teeth.
</p>

<p>
'Beware, Chevalier, beware!' said I, infuriated by the sight
of my own blood; 'I have sworn to write my name on your
skin with a good Scottish dagger!'
</p>

<p>
'And yet, dog, 'tis to my worthless sister you owe your
frippery!&mdash;yea, life itself!' he added, with a terrible glance.
</p>

<p>
'True, true; let us pass&mdash;let us part!' said I, feeling
sudden compunction, and standing only on my defence.
</p>

<p>
'In a moment I shall kill you&mdash;adieu! do you call that
fencing? no lover could be a greater fool than you!&mdash;Ah,
queen of heaven!&mdash;I am gone!' he exclaimed, and tossed his
sword into the air.  As he threw up his hands, the blood gushed
from his mouth, and he fell on his face.  A ball, fired by Lord
Dundrennan at another person, had pierced his chest, and
slain him!
</p>

<p>
On his fall all resistance ceased; and thus, after considerable
loss, at seven o'clock on the morning of the 25th July,
1635, the Scottish general of Louis XIII. hoisted the French
standard on the ramparts of La Mothe.

CHAPTER XXV.
<br /><br />
LETTERS FOR PARIS.
</h3>

<p>
Sir Robert Bruce of Blairhall, and Sir Archibald Douglas
of Heriotmuir, with other gallant gentlemen, French and
Scottish, who were slain in this assault, we buried with all
honour and solemnity in the church of La Mothe.  I found
the body of the silver-haired Sir Archibald lying close to the
barrier gate, surrounded by piles of dead men.  Near his hand
lay a broadsword he would never grasp again.  It was an old
family weapon, and on its blade was engraved, '<i>Att Floddenfield
and Pinkycleuch</i>.'  I also found the Chevalier d'Ische.  As he
lay dead within the Bastion de Louise, how difficult of
recognition through that hideous mask of powder, blood, and dust,
were the handsome features of the young and reckless Bailiff
of Bassignie!  I thought of the gay and beautiful Clara&mdash;she
whose miniature by Poussin I still wore at my neck&mdash;and my
soul grew sad, as the pikemen of Arpajou bore him away to
his hastily-made grave.
</p>

<p>
Our trumpets sounded <i>à cheval</i>, 'to horse;' for all the
cavalry were now to advance in pursuit of the Prince of
Vaudemont, who had effected his escape towards the Maese;
and loud and shrill they rang between the mountain peaks,
where so many lay that never more would rise until the
trumpet of the archangel wakes that wooded valley with its
final blast.
</p>

<p>
I had my foot in the stirrup of Dagobert, and was in the
act of mounting to advance with the cuirassiers, when the
Laird of Tushielaw summoned me to the presence of the
Camp-Marechal Hepburn, whom I found at the house of the defunct
Governor of La Mothe, and seated in a splendid apartment,
the tapestry of which represented the victories of Charles VII.
over the English.
</p>

<p>
The Marquis of Gordon, Vicomtes Turenne and Arpajou,
with other glittering nobles and chevaliers, were
lounging about, speaking of the recent assault, drinking the
Burgundy of poor Raoul d'Ische, and making considerable
noise and merriment.
</p>

<p>
'This capture is quite equal to a victory in the field,' said
Turenne.
</p>

<p>
'All Paris will speak of it for three days at least,' added
Arpajou.
</p>

<p>
'Three days,' said Hepburn, folding a letter which he had
just concluded; 'only three days you think, M. le Vicomte?'
</p>

<p>
'Peste! that is a long time for Parisians to talk of one
thing, believe me, Camp-Marechal,' said our captain the
Marquis; 'but here is my friend Mr. Blane.'
</p>

<p>
'I know of none so worthy to carry my despatch to Paris
as you Mr. Blane,' said Sir John; 'and you will convey it
to the feet of king Louis, with the standard which you captured
so valiantly at Bitche.  Be prepared to leave this in an
hour!'
</p>

<p>
'Paris&mdash;ah!  Mon Dieu, how I envy you!' said de Toneins
and several others.
</p>

<p>
I bowed, and retired to make my brief preparations for a
journey that was not without great danger, as the way for
miles to our rear, through Alsace and Lorraine, lay through
the country of the enemy.
</p>

<p>
The moment it became known in Hepburn's camp that I
was to ride for Paris, letters for all the fair dames of that
intriguing capital were poured upon me, until I flatly refused
to take more.  Dundrennan, the Chevalier Livingstone, and
I know not how many others, gave me billets for
Mademoiselle Ninon de l'Enclos.  The Marquis of Gordon gave
me one for Clara d'Amboise; Arpajou gave me one for
Madame de Bouillon; Turenne gave me another for the
lovely Mademoiselle de Chevreuse; and, among many others,
the young Marquis de Toneins, though wounded, and in love
with the divorced Duchess of Charost, gave me a little
pink-scented billet, which I was to deliver personally to
Mademoiselle de l'Orme.  In short, there was a perplexing
obliquity of morality, and oblivion of all marriage and family
ties in this precious post-bag of mine, that was quite Parisian,
and suited to the French taste of the age; for every one
seemed to be in love with his friend's wife; and thus laden,
with Hepburn's despatch concealed in the lining of my cuirass,
I bade adieu to my gallant comrades, who resumed their
march towards the Rhine, while I turned the head of Dagobert
regretfully towards Paris the beautiful&mdash;Paris, the city
of perdition.
</p>

<p>
'Take care of Mademoiselle de l'Orme,' was the parting
advice of the Marquis of Gordon; 'lest she wile you to love
her.'
</p>

<p>
'And what then, Marquis?' said I, gaily.
</p>

<p>
'She will break your heart, and fling it to the devil, as she
has broken and flung those of others.'
</p>

<p>
'Farewell&mdash;I shall be wary, believe me.'
</p>

<p>
'Adieu'&mdash;and I galloped off.

CHAPTER XXVI.
<br /><br />
THE CASTLE OF VERSAILLES.
</h3>

<p>
I traversed all the land of Lorraine, and never drew bridle
save when I could not, without destroying my fine Spanish
barb, press him further, or faster.
</p>

<p>
On passing the borders of Champagne, I proceeded more at
my leisure, and after a pleasant journey of about thirty miles
per day, found myself one evening, in the beginning of August,
trotting down the Rue de l'Arbre Sec, towards the old
familiar masses of the magnificent Louvre, with all the buzz,
bustle, chatter, gaiety, dust, and sunshine of Paris around me;
and once more I saw its spires glooming in the twilight of
azure and gold.
</p>

<p>
His Majesty was hunting at his country castle of Versailles
(it was only a castle then), and would not return for a week;
thus, after halting for refreshment and repose at my old hotel,
the <i>Golden Fleur-de-lis</i>, in the Rue d'Ecosse, where Maître
Pierre Omelette was still extant in all his glory and amplitude
of night-cap and white apron, I flung all the frivolous
billets with which I was intrusted into the box of the Hotel
des Postes&mdash;all save those for Mademoiselle de l'Orme, whom
I was anxious to see, and hiring a fresh horse, departed next
day for the royal hunting-seat, without making any detour
towards the château d'Amboise, though I looked wistfully at
its shining vanes, and steep slated turrets as they rose above
the coppice with a cloud of pigeons wheeling round them;
but I rode rapidly on, feeling piqued, because the handsome
and gay Marquis of Gordon had written to Clara, and had
given me the letter to carry.  Moreover I dreaded to meet
her natural grief for her brother's death, and resolved seriously
to consider the expedience of my visit, <i>after</i> the delivery of
my despatch.
</p>

<p>
At this time, when the imperial general had nearly made
himself master of all the bailiwick of Vaudevrange, and
encamped his army between the Save and the Wilde, that he
might more effectually succour the Duke of Lorraine; and
when France and her allies were most unsuccessful in Italy,
where the Duke of Parma was stripped of his territories
by the encroaching Spaniards, notwithstanding all the valiant
efforts of the French troops under the Marechal Duc de
Crecqui, couriers or officers bearing despatches were ever
anxiously waited for at the Louvre and Versailles, and by no
one more than Richelieu, who had precipitated France into
this war with the German empire.
</p>

<p>
In a short time I approached Versailles, a small village on
a rising ground, about twelve miles westward from Paris, and
entered the avenue which led to the country palace or hunting
castle built by Louis XIII.  It is an edifice entirely of brick,
coped with stone, crowned by balustrades and sculptured
trophies, busts, and vases.  All the statues, eighty in number,
are antiques of white marble, and stand on carved corbeilles
between the windows.  In the centre is a balcony supported
by eight Doric columns of richly-veined marble.  Under this
balcony stood a gentleman of the Scottish Guard, one of the
twenty-four archers, on duty with his arquebuse, talking to
some young nobles and Gray Mousquetaires, who were
lounging about the grand entrance, and making it seem quite
gay, with their slashed pourpoints and plumed hats.
</p>

<p>
Little hills that teem with game surround this quaint old
hunting castle, on which, since those days, Louis XIV. has
engrafted one of the most magnificent palaces in the world.
</p>

<p>
Just as I dismounted, and gave the reins of my horse to a
groom in the royal livery, a vehement blowing of horns,
accompanied by the yelling and barking of dogs, the tramp of
horses, and cracking of whips, approached, and I beheld the
King ride up, surrounded by a gay and joyous but travel-stained
band of hunters&mdash;the four dukes, who were gentlemen
of his chamber, the grand huntsman, the grand faucormier,
a pack of hounds, and a host of grooms and keepers.  They
all came up by that stately path of ancient elms, the rows of
which are twenty fathoms wide, and which lead from the old
brick castle towards Paris.
</p>

<p>
I begged M. de Brissac, a gentleman of the Duc de
Bouillon, and formerly a captain in St. Lacy's dragoons,
who was riding beside the King, to mention that a courier
had arrived from the army; and my request&mdash;or the words of
it&mdash;spread like wildfire.
</p>

<p>
'A courier from the army?' said one.
</p>

<p>
'Which army&mdash;we have five in the field?' asked a second.
</p>

<p>
'The army of the Rhine,' replied a third.
</p>

<p>
'From Italy, I believe,' said M. de Brissac.
</p>

<p>
'Ah!' exclaimed the Duc de St. Simon; 'from the
Marechal Duc de Crecqui?'
</p>

<p>
'Has he taken Parma from the Spaniards?'
</p>

<p>
'Yes&mdash;of course.  Parbleu! 'tis glorious.'
</p>

<p>
'Parma is taken.  Vive le Marechal Duc de Crecqui!'
</p>

<p>
Thus, amid confused shouts and blowing of horns, I found
myself standing uncovered beside the stirrup of the timid and
querulous king, who was in the act of opening a long
despatch, which had just been handed to him by another officer,
who, as De Brissac told me, had just arrived from the Duc de
Rohan; and in this officer, who had preceded me by three
minutes, I recognized my countryman the young Earl of
Irvine, a colonel of foot.  He looked pale, thin, and
emaciated, for his right hand had been shot off.
</p>

<p>
'My brave M. Irvine,' said the King, 'what reward must
yours be?'
</p>

<p>
'Permission to serve your Majesty with my left hand, since
the right is lying at the foot of the Alps.'
</p>

<p>
'Thou art a valiant Scot!' exclaimed the King, opening
the despatch.'
</p>

<p>
But his countenance grew dark as he read on, for the letter
detailed, in the gentlest manner, an undeniable defeat; and
every lip was hushed and every eye bent on him while he
made himself master of its contents.
</p>

<p>
'Mordieu!' he exclaimed in an altered tone; 'so&mdash;so my
lord, you were defeated at a place which M. de Rohan calls
Bormio?'
</p>

<p>
'Pardon me, sire,' replied the politic Earl, with a profound
bow; 'we were not defeated&mdash;your Majesty's troops never
are.  We simply retired, and left some of our soldiers in
possession of the field.'
</p>

<p>
'Ah! the killed and wounded, I suppose,' said the King,
with a sardonic grin.
</p>

<p>
'Alas! sire,' resumed the young Earl, 'I have still worse
tidings to give, for it was rumoured in our army that your
Majesty's most faithful and valiant ally, Monseigneur the Duke
of Saxe-Weimar, is dying.'
</p>

<p>
'Dying!' reiterated the petulant king; 'what business has
he to think of dying just now, after luring us into this German
war; and just at the time when we need his assistance most?
But good, my lord, go&mdash;and let us see you no more at
Versailles until you have other tidings to give than those of the
defeat of our armies and death of our allies.'
</p>

<p>
As the Earl turned haughtily away, I heard him mutter,
</p>

<p>
'There never was a Scottish king dared speak to a Scottish
earl, as this pampered Bourbon has this day spoken to me!'
</p>

<p>
And without according the least salute to Louis, he strode
away, and next day left his service.
</p>

<p>
I now approached.
</p>

<p>
'Another courier&mdash;Oho! 'tis a cuirassier of our valiant
Scottish Guard; a good omen by St. Louis!  Your
despatch;&mdash;thanks, monsieur.
</p>

<p>
He tore it open, and there was again profound stillness as
the king scanned it.  He made himself master of its contents
at a glance, and then read it aloud that all might hear, while
I remained on one knee at his side, with the standard of
Lorraine in my hands.
</p>

<p>
'Pardieu! this is good&mdash;this is brave!  Well done, my
valiant Hepburn&mdash;thou shalt be a Marechal of France!'
exclaimed the King, as his eyes flashed with sudden energy and
pride.  'Alsace is ours!'
</p>

<p>
'Vive le Camp-Marechal Hepburn&mdash;Alsace is ours!' repeated
the courtiers, and there was a vehement clapping of
hands.
</p>

<p>
'The Prince of Vaudemont routed before Bitche, and his
standard taken by M. Blane, of our Garde du Corps Ecossais;
a thousand troop-horses captured, and fifty of the enemy slain
in the valley of Ingweiler by this same M. Blane; La Mothe
stormed, the bailiff of Bassignie killed, and the troops of
Hepburn pushing onward to the German frontier&mdash;to the Rhine
which shall be ours!  Let the bells be rung and the cannon
fired!  But who are you, monsieur?' asked Louis, turning to
me.
</p>

<p>
'Arthur Blane, of the Scottish Guard, sir.'
</p>

<p>
'Good, my friend, kings have bad memories; but you will
soon find that mine is an exception.'
</p>

<p>
My heart danced with joy as he gave me his hand to kiss,
and held up the standard in view of his attendants, whose
applause again burst forth with a rapture truly French.
</p>

<p>
'Tonnerre de Ciel!' said Louis, glancing again at the
despatch; 'our loss in men is considerable.'
</p>

<p>
'Heed it not, sire,' replied the gay Duke de Bouillon;
'the boys born this week in our good and virtuous city of Paris
will replace the loss in battle.'
</p>

<p>
'And so M. le Chevalier Hepburn is in full march to
attack Count Gallas?'
</p>

<p>
'Yes, sire.'
</p>

<p>
'Mohammed condescended to go to the mountain; so, as
M. le Comte will not come to meet the troops of France, we
must march them to fight M. le Comte.  Bon!' exclaimed
Louis, rubbing his hands.
</p>

<p>
He was about to address me again, as I stood the cynosure
of a thousand eyes, when suddenly a carriage, escorted by twelve
mounted musketeers, wheeled up the ancient avenue of elms;
and Louis muttered, while nervously folding the despatch,&mdash;
</p>

<p>
'Here comes our devil of a Cardinal!  Ah&mdash;your Eminence
is welcome&mdash;we have just got despatches&mdash;&mdash;'
</p>

<p>
'From the Duke de Rohan and the Chevalier Hepburn,'
replied the Cardinal, coldly.
</p>

<p>
'How know you that?' asked the King, with astonishment.
</p>

<p>
'I know every man who approaches your Majesty,' replied
the Cardinal, with a cold smile: 'you bore letters from our
army of the Rhine?' he added, turning abruptly to me.
</p>

<p>
I bowed.
</p>

<p>
Furtively and swiftly, he gave me a fierce and hawk-like
glance of hostility, and followed the King into the castle of
Versailles.  The attendants flocked after them, and I was left
standing almost alone in the Cour de Marble.
</p>

<p>
The strange glance of this terrible man startled me.  I
knew not how to account for its expression; but I feared him,
and felt assured that I had incurred his displeasure&mdash;that he
hated me!  While standing irresolute whether or not to
retire, M. de Brissac, the kinsman of the Duke de Bouillon,
approached, with an intimation that a collation awaited me,
after which I was to return to the Louvre, and there, after
reporting myself to the officer commanding the archers of the
Garde du Corps Ecossais, to await despatches, which I was to
convey to the army.

<h3>
CHAPTER XXVII.
<br /><br />
CLARA'S MINIATURE, AND HOW IT PROVED A TALISMAN.
</h3>

<p>
At luncheon M. de Brissac and I were joined by the Earl of
Irvine and several young sparks of the French Guards,
glittering with jewels, velvets, and cloth of gold.  We were
attended by servants in the royal livery of France.  The
collation was luxurious; the wines rare beyond price, and served
up in a lofty apartment, the walls of which were painted
azure, powdered with silver lilies, and the ceiling was decorated
by an allegorical subject, representing France as a beautiful
woman, in whose half nude and wholly voluptuous figure, I
recognized Clara d'Amboise, seated in a car drawn by white
swans, and attended by Ceres, Flora, Pomona, and other
goddesses, whose faces were those of Chevreuse, de Guerchi, and
other court beauties, who were conducting her to the temple
of Virtue.
</p>

<p>
The war, duels, and girls were the usual topics of conversation.
I detailed all the particulars of our brilliant charge at
Bitche; on which Lord Irvine said, with an air of pique,
</p>

<p>
'So it was only an affair of horse&mdash;a little charivari&mdash;nothing
more.'
</p>

<p>
'Rather more successful than your marshal's at Bormio, however!'
</p>

<p>
'Oh, do not speak of Bormio; we had there a more dreadful
day than I shall ever see until the day of doom!  There,
gentlemen, the best blood in France was battening in the sun
upon the Alps, and dying the waters of the Fredolfo purple.
My dearest friend was there mortally wounded by my side in
dragging me wounded, as you see, from the press, and expired
that night placing his wife in my arms as a sacred trust.'
</p>

<p>
'A pleasant little arrangement,' said De Brissac gaily; 'I
hope the lady was handsome.'
</p>

<p>
'I do not understand you, monsieur,' replied the young
Earl, gravely; 'my faith is for my friend&mdash;my sword is at the
service of the King.'
</p>

<p>
'So is mine, my Lord,' said the gay Brissac; 'and moreover
my hand and moustache are at the service of all fair ladies
of his court.  Morbleu! don't let us quarrel over this excellent
wine; but tell us, M. Blane, got you much plunder in Alsace?'
</p>

<p>
'A younger son's share only; but whose stately château is
that, on the other side of the water?' I asked, pointing to a
large edifice which was visible between the elms.
</p>

<p>
'That is Trianon, a retreat of the King's.  He comes to
Versailles when tired of Paris; and goes lo Trianon when tired of
Versailles.'
</p>

<p>
'Of which he will soon tire now,' said a chevalier of the
French guards, with a wicked wink.
</p>

<p>
'You smile, monsieur?' said I.
</p>

<p>
'Of course.'
</p>

<p>
'Why?'
</p>

<p>
'Madame d'Amboise is there just now.'
</p>

<p>
'At Trianon?'
</p>

<p>
'Yes.'
</p>

<p>
'And Anne of Austria&mdash;'
</p>

<p>
'Is no doubt busy with M. le Cardinal, adjusting the
boundaries of France at the Rhine.'
</p>

<p>
There was such a loud explosion of laughter at this remark,
that I am sure 'M. le Cardinal' would have knit his brows
had he heard it.
</p>

<p>
Trianon was in the form of an oval; in the centre was a
large iron gate, having two sentinels of the French line,
pacing before it.  It had numerous pavilions crowned by
glittering vanes; and its cornice was surmounted by an
elaborate balustrade, and row of porcelain vases.  It was gaily
beautiful, for everywhere flowers bloomed, fountains played,
and golden fish swam in the ponds around it.
</p>

<p>
Again my old emotions of pique at the Countess returned,
and I resolved to depart at once to Paris, after thanking
M. de Brissac for his courtesy, and drinking a farewell bumper to
the Earl of Irvine.
</p>

<p>
This young peer was a son of Archibald seventh Earl of
Argyle.  He had served long against the Spaniards, and
obtained a Scottish earldom from Charles I.; but died without
heirs-male, and his title became extinct.  He was brave,
handsome, and a mirror of military honour.
</p>

<p>
I did not leave immediately for Paris, but wandered
irresolutely about Versailles.  The afternoon proved hot and
sultry.  There was not a breath of wind to stir a leaf of the
three avenues of giant elms that diverge from the castle.
The air and the canals between the latter and Trianon were
alike still and motionless.  The sun played with a golden
gleam between the glittering fountains, on the yellow fruit
of the orangery, and cast long flakes of hazy light athwart
the deep shady vistas of the greater avenue; and now since the
hunting-train had dispersed, all seemed lifeless and calm about
this beautiful summer residence of Louis XIII.
</p>

<p>
While gazing at Trianon, across the verdant lawns, (then
studded with the little daisy called in France "la belle
Marguerite," from the Virgin of Cortona,) and pondering which
apartment of that long façade, that is sixty-four fathoms broad,
was occupied by the Countess, I seated myself upon a rustic
sofa under a broad umbrageous elm, and drawing her miniature
from my breast, unclasped and looked upon it, remembering
her remarkable advice to wear it constantly for her sake, as it
might 'prove a <i>talisman</i>, should I ever get into trouble.'
</p>

<p>
Something of the old and dangerous tenderness this fascinating
woman had excited in my young breast rose again within
me, as I gazed upon her beautiful face and winning smile; but
while these thoughts coursed through my heart and head, the
hot champagne seemed bubbling to my brain; the avenue, the
palace and its fountains swam around me, and overcome by
the languor of the day, the toil of my late journey, and the
potent wine of the most Christian king, I fell into a sound
sleep, with the miniature open in my hand&mdash;the miniature of
the King's mistress, whose face was as well known to the court
as the great clock of Notre Dame de Paris; and this was
within a pistol-shot of the gate of Versailles!'
</p>

<p>
How long I slept I know not, but I awoke chilled and stiff.
</p>

<p>
The lengthened shadows of the elm-trees, and the deepening
gloom that fell across the courts of Versailles, warned me that
the day was past, and I started up.
</p>

<p>
'The miniature!' thought I.
</p>

<p>
Anxious and bewildered I searched for it on every side,
but searched in vain.  It had been stolen from me while
I slept; and not daring to make any inquiry after it, I was
glad to mount and ride back at a furious pace to Paris, with a
vague hope of leaving danger behind me.
</p>

<p>
I had soon reason to repent the loss of my <i>talisman</i>.

<h3>
CHAPTER XXVIII.
<br /><br />
MARION DE L'ORME.
</h3>

<p>
After putting my costume in proper order, I placed a new
plume in my hat, pointed up my moustache, perfumed my hair
like a court gallant, and sent little Poquelin about dusk for a
fiacre, in which I was driven to the house of Marion de l'Orme,
for whom I had no less than six billets, one of which was from
my friend the Marquis de Toneins, son of the Marechal Duke
de la Force.
</p>

<p>
I felt confused and anxious while I was driven through the
streets; and amid the clatter of wooden shoes and the cries of
dealers in nicotina, perfumed wash-balls, walking canes, and
bonbons, I thought only of the loss of the miniature, and its
probable results if it fell into evil hands.  Mademoiselle de
l'Orme's residence was in the Rue St. Jacques, and adjoined
an old house which was one of the sights of Paris, for therein
Alexander II. of Scotland, when on a visit to Queen Blanche,
the mother of Louis IX., visited St. Dominique, the confessor,
in 1219, so it was old enough, you may be assured.
</p>

<p>
As I rang the bell at the gate of the Hôtel de l'Orme&mdash;for
so was her handsome mansion styled&mdash;and gazed upward at its
row of illuminated windows, I felt a glow of interest at the
anticipation of being tête-à-tête with this remarkable woman,
who had become so celebrated throughout all France for her
gallantries, the number of her lovers, the lustre of her beauty,
and the reckless manner in which she broke through and
trampled under her pretty foot all the rules by which the
women of the Christian world have hitherto been guided.
</p>

<p>
I gave my name to a porter in the court; he, in turn, gave
it to a valet in the vestibule, who repeated to a third on the
staircase, and in due time I was ushered into a magnificent
saloon, where waxlights, perfume, persons in glittering dresses,
gorgeous furniture, and rich hangings appeared on all sides,
like a brilliant scene at the Opera Française, and forming a
strange contrast to those which I had seen for some time
past&mdash;the trenches of La Mothe and the tents of Hepburn's
army.
</p>

<p>
On three sides of this saloon, the tapestry of silk represented
an allegory of Fame proclaiming by trumpet-sound the
happiness of France; while Justice, sword in hand, drove away
whole legions of Sedition, Discord, and Envy.  The fourth
side portrayed the proudest scene in the military history of
'Scotland's ancient enemies'&mdash;the brave Black Prince waiting
at supper upon the King of France, on the same day he had
conquered and taken him prisoner.  The furniture was all of
walnut (each piece a miracle of carving), or of buhl, and
beautifully inlaid with shell and mother-of-pearl.  Statues,
bronzes, pictures, and countless objects of virtù and bijouterie
were strewed around the tables of this long saloon, the carpets
of which were of the softest Persian manufacture.  As I
perceived all these details at a glance, a gentleman, clad almost
entirely in blue velvet and cloth of silver, started forward
from amid the splendid group that were lounging around the
low fauteuil, on which Marion de l'Orme was seated like a
princess.  He was my new acquaintance, M. de Brissac, then
her most favoured lover; and, taking me by the hand, he at
once presented me as 'a gentleman of the Guard, just arrived
from the camp of the Chevalier Hepburn.'  She received me
with the most enchanting grace; and, giving me her perfumed
hand to kiss, placed the six billets in a casket, to be read or
burned when she was more at leisure.
</p>

<p>
She made me sit beside her on the fauteuil, for she had a
hundred questions to ask&mdash;about the charge at Bitche; the
storming of La Mothe; who were killed, who were wounded,
and who had escaped; and whether I thought the ladies of
Lorraine as charming as those of Paris.  Then, in her
inquiries, she strung together the names of counts, marquises,
and chevaliers, captains, lieutenants, and musketeers, without
giving me time to reply; and among the names of her friends
she enumerated nearly all the cuirassiers of the Garde du
Corps Ecossais.  The brilliance of her manner, her wit and
vivacity, dazzled and charmed, while it silenced and at times
almost stunned me.
</p>

<p>
Her face was perfect in feature and regal in contour; her
eyes were dark, but full of light, and a hundred varying
expressions passed through them; her teeth and lips were as
those of a child; her jet-black hair was gathered in braids and
folds, which displayed to perfection the form and pure
whiteness of her temples, her slender neck, and little ears, from
each of which hung a diamond pendant worth six thousand
francs, the gift, as I was afterwards informed, of the young
marquis, our captain.  She was attired in rose-coloured satin,
trimmed with four flounces of black lace; her long peaked
stomacher was golden cloth; her necklace, bracelets, rings,
and the jewels among her hair, were sparkling with diamonds,
which enhanced the splendour and the delicacy of her beauty.
</p>

<p>
The passionate light that filled the eyes of this dangerous
woman made my heart flutter when she smiled on me, and
caused me to dream of the joy of being loved by her as
she twice gave me her hand to kiss&mdash;the loveliest hand in
Paris.
</p>

<p>
Marion de l'Orme was then in her twenty-fourth year,
having been born at Chalons sur Marne, in Champagne.
Her father was a gentleman of property, who could have
given her about sixty thousand francs as a marriage portion;
but she preferred a life of gallantry and freedom, such as the
reigns of Henry IV. and his successors had made fashionable,
and thus she wickedly despised a reputable settlement.
</p>

<p>
Lovers taught her soon&mdash;too soon&mdash;that she was beautiful,
that she was witty, and that there was a divine grace in all
she did.  She sang well, excelled in the guitar, and was wont
to admit that she had loved passionately&mdash;at least while the
love lasted&mdash;eight or nine consecutive lovers.  The first was
Des Barreaux, the next was Rouville, of whom she soon
wearied, as he was not handsome enough; but the poor fellow
fought a duel about her with his successor, La Ferte Senecterre,
and left this valley of tears with three feet of a rapier in his
body.  Then came Miossens, to whom she took a fancy as he
caracoled his horse along the Boulevardes, and to whom she
bluntly sent a little pink note, inviting him to come and sup
with her.  Then followed Arnauld, the unfortunate Cinq
Mars, who was beheaded by Richelieu; M. de Chatillon; the
Marquis de Gordon, who was forgotten as soon as our drums
died away on the road to Lorraine; and lastly, my new friend,
M. de Brissac, whom I should have found little difficulty in
supplanting had I been so disposed.  Cardinal Richelieu
himself was among her lovers.  He gave her a cane worth six
hundred francs, and she used to visit his Eminence dressed as
a page; for her whims were ever rash, fantastic, and
unaccountable.
</p>

<p>
Love excepted, Marion had no frailty, and she had many
virtues.  She chatted away of her past amours with a
coolness which surprised me.  Perceiving that M. de Brissac
was admiring Cupid and Psyche, a beautiful group in
bronze&mdash;
</p>

<p>
'Ah!' said she, 'that was a gift from poor Senecterre;
and the buhl pedestal on which it stands, was given to me by
that wretch Miossens, whose moustache had always such a
horrid odour of nicotina.'
</p>

<p>
'And this beautiful casket,' said I, 'excels that of the
Duchess d'Ancre.'
</p>

<p>
'Scarcely, in size at least,' said Marion; 'for the Duchess,
in her famous casket, carried all her jewels, together with her
best locks and bosom.  The buhl table that it stands on was
a present from dear Cinq Mars, who thought himself so
handsome.  There was a time when I thought him so too,
but then he was such a self-willed toad that he bored me.
And so, M. Blane, my gay friend, the little Marquis de
Toneins was actually wounded at your terrible La Mothe?'
</p>

<p>
'Yes, mademoiselle, in ascending the breach.'
</p>

<p>
'Ah! he sought the bubble reputation even at the cannon's
mouth, but in lieu of the bubble got the ball, which
M. Shakespeare forgot to consider.  I doubt not, my dear M. Blane,
your despatches will cause many a tear to be shed in France.'
</p>

<p>
'True, mademoiselle,' said De Brissac, with a sentimental
air; 'many an eye, lovely as your own, that God made only
for smiling, now is compelled to weep.'
</p>

<p>
'But their tears will only render brighter the laurels which
bedeck the brows of the survivors.  The number who have
fallen saddens, doubtless, our glory and triumph, but,' she
added, with her fine eyes flashing, 'they fell for France,
bequeathing victory to her and to their comrades.  Is it not so,
my dear M. Blane?'
</p>

<p>
A burst of applause from her admirers prevented me from
replying; and then she asked, in a low voice&mdash;
</p>

<p>
'Is the wound of De Toneins severe?'
</p>

<p>
'Rather, mademoiselle; yet I know of a pain greater than
even a musket-shot can inflict.'
</p>

<p>
'Indeed; what is it, pray?'
</p>

<p>
'To feign indifference where we feel but&mdash;love,' said I,
with an air so gallant and tender that it won me an approving
smile from Marion and a frown from M. de Brissac, of which
mark of displeasure I was resolved to be quite oblivious; for
what the deuce was M. de Brissac to me?
</p>

<p>
'And you feel this often, M. Blane?' she asked, with an
inexplicable glance, in which drollery predominated.
</p>

<p>
'Nay, mademoiselle, I never felt it until now,' I replied,
sinking my voice, as an irresistible spirit of gallantry urged
me on; 'I am unused to the society of one so beautiful; so
pray, mademoiselle, excuse my diffidence.'
</p>

<p>
'Gentlemen are ever telling me that I am beautiful,' said
Marion, pettishly; 'I would rather be beloved.'
</p>

<p>
Fortunately&mdash;for there was a malevolent gleam in the eyes
of De Brissac&mdash;the servants appeared with a cold collation,
served up in silver and Bohemian crystal of crimson flowered
with gold.  We had wines of the most expensive description
to overflowing, and a hundred gay anecdotes and witty
remarks were given on all sides; for the boudoir of Marion de
l'Orme was not a place to repress the liveliest sallies of the
wits and sparks who hovered about her, and who courted her
smiles.  I remember that De Brissac made us all laugh by the
pointed and satirical manner in which he related a droll story
of the Bishop of Auvergne, who was sorely tried and tempted
by the devil, who met him in his cathedral church at night in
the form of a handsome woman with very scanty garments.
Then Marion assumed her guitar, and sang to us first an old
ballad of the Palatines of Champagne; and then a Spanish
romance, in which a lover declared that once when thinking of
his mistress he fell into a pond, where <i>the heat of his passion</i>
had such an effect on the water, that it bubbled up and boiled
all the fish&mdash;the trout, perch, and carp&mdash;so that his friends who
came to hook him out, forgot all about him in the delicious
repast afforded them by the ready-cooked spoil of the waters.
</p>

<p>
These songs, stories, and the generous wine put us all in
excellent humour.
</p>

<p>
'Everything here is princely,' said I to a grave-looking
cavalier, who wore the Grand Cross of Malta.
</p>

<p>
'Yes,' he replied with a sardonic grin; 'for the love of
Mademoiselle is a commodity that rises in value according to
the season in Paris, and the rank of her adorers.'
</p>

<p>
This was evidently a disappointed man; but Marion gave
more to the poor than any ten Priors of his order.
</p>

<p>
'Fill your glasses, gentlemen,' exclaimed De Brissac, standing
on one of the rich tapestry chairs; 'fill them to the brim.
I mean to parody old Martial for the occasion, thus:&mdash;
</p>

<p class="poem">
  'Let six full cups to Nævia's health go round,<br />
  And <i>fair de l'Orme's</i> with <i>seven</i> full cups be crowned.'<br />
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
'Vivat, messieurs! off with them!' and the mad cavaliers
drained seven in succession; but after this it pleased M. de
Brissac to become very cross, jealous, and suspicious; and,
assuming his plumed hat and long sword, he proposed to
leave.
</p>

<p>
'Well, if you are determined to be unpleasant, assuredly I
shall not detain you,' said Marion, with a tone of pique;
'but,' she added in a kinder whisper, 'when am I to have
that diamond necklace from the queen's jeweller?'
</p>

<p>
'I know not,' he answered, gloomily; 'and I care not.'
</p>

<p>
'Indeed!'
</p>

<p>
'Yes,' he replied, twisting his right moustache.
</p>

<p>
'It is only six hundred paltry crowns.'
</p>

<p>
'Crowns of the sun&mdash;mordieu! my wife's cost but two
hundred.'
</p>

<p>
'What is Madame to me?'
</p>

<p>
'More than I am, apparently,' retorted de Brissac, as he
thrust his broad beaver on his head, and retired in a gust of
wine and passion; but not without levelling a dark glance at
me.
</p>

<p>
In an hour after, I tired of this witty and brilliant but
loose company, and bade Marion adieu.  As I kissed her
hand, she gave me a glance so bright and tender, that I would
not have given a brass bodle for the chances of M. de Brissac,
had I deemed it worth my while to attempt supplanting him
in her favour; for the silver saltire of the Scottish Guard
bore all before it in Paris; but, save once in her coach on the
Boulevards, I never saw Marion again.
</p>

<p>
This wild and remarkable girl, whose beauty turned the
heads of all the gallants in Paris, died at the early age of
thirty-nine, after four days' illness, when she was still lovely as
ever.  Of the cause of her death, I dare not trust myself to
write; and but for the reckless life she led, she might have
preserved her wondrous beauty longer.  She had divine hands,
and never wore a pair of gloves for more than three hours.
She left sixty thousand francs' worth of dresses and ornaments.
She never accepted a denier from a lover; but yet had
presents of dresses, jewellery, plate, and furniture sufficient to
stock the Louvre.
</p>

<p>
During her last illness, which made a great sensation in
Paris and in the French camp, she confessed ten times to a
priest, having always something new, some little forgotten sin
to communicate.  The gallants of Paris, and all her former
admirers, laid her body in state for twenty-four hours, with a
maiden crown on her head; but the austere curé of St. Gervais
very properly denounced this proceeding as a ridiculous
scandal, and tore it from the corpse; yet Marion
looked so beautiful in her pure white shroud, that the
'Gazette Historique de Loret,' of the 30th June, 1650, has
the following epigram upon her:&mdash;
</p>

<p class="poem">
  'Le pauvre Marion de l'Orme,<br />
  De si rare et plaisante forme;<br />
  A saissi ravis au tombeau,<br />
  Son corps si charmant et si beau!'<br />
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
Marion had three sisters, all very attractive girls.  The
eldest, Madame de la Montague, a beautiful blonde, was
wont somewhat rashly to boast&mdash;'we have no riches, but we
have honour;' yet my friend Viscount Dundrennan, like
M. de Moret, nearly broke his neck when descending one night
from her chamber window.
</p>

<p>
The youngest and least artful was married, to M. Maugiron,
Treasurer of the Artillery du Roi, who served with me in the
campaign of Alsace.  As they lived in the arsenal, old
Marechal de la Meilleraye, though he had not a tooth in his
head, fell in love with her; but finding that she was carrying
on an intrigue with the Cardinal de Retz, he revengefully
deprived her poor husband of his commission; and this is all
that I know of the family of the gayest woman that ever
influenced the scandalous, joyous, and immoral city of Paris.

<h3>
CHAPTER XXIX.
<br /><br />
ARRESTED.
</h3>

<p>
To resume my own narrative: I had proceeded from the Rue
St. Jacques, after a somewhat devious course, along the Rue
Betizi and the Fosses St. Germain l'Auxerrois, when at the
place where the latter is intersected by the Rue de l'Arbre
Sec, a dark and ancient street that leads from the Rue St. Honoré
to the Seine, I found all the oil-lamps extinguished, and
a fiacre, surrounded by twelve foot musketeers of the Comte de
Treville's company, standing fairly in the centre of the way.
At that moment the clock of St. Germain tolled two; but
daybreak seemed far distant, as the shadows lay deep and
black in the quaint and overhanging streets of Paris.
</p>

<p>
'Halt, monsieur, and give up your sword,' said a muffled
man, whose voice was familiar to me.
</p>

<p>
'Not to a mere mousquetaire,' said I, unsheathing it, and
standing on my guard; 'and least of all to one of your rank,
my ex-captain of horse; for now I recognise you, worthy
Monsieur de Brissac.'
</p>

<p>
'Bah! did not Francis I. of France give up his to the
son of a butcher?'
</p>

<p>
'True, when only three of the Scottish Guard remained on
their feet beside him, and a mountain of slain lay round them.
By St. Andrew&mdash;'
</p>

<p>
'Hark!' said a musketeer; 'a Huguenot swears by St. Andrew.'
</p>

<p>
'Surrender your sword, Monsieur Arthur Blane, I
command you!' reiterated Brissac.
</p>

<p>
'You have a warrant, I presume?'
</p>

<p>
'Peste! you are particular!&mdash;'
</p>

<p>
'Most people usually are, under these circumstances.'
</p>

<p>
'My word and sword should be warrant enough; but
here is the document,' said he, holding a paper close lo one
of the lamps of the fiacre.  '<i>Louis, par la Grace de Dieu, Roi
de France et de Navarre,</i>' &amp;c. &amp;c., 'signed at our castle of
Versailles,' and so forth, all in due form.  'What the devil
would you have more?  I have arrested a Bishop and a
Marechal of France&mdash;ay, Monseigneur de Montmorenci
himself&mdash;with infinitely less ceremony.'
</p>

<p>
Inflamed with anger and alarm, and irresolute whether to
fight, fly, or yield, I still kept my point towards him.
</p>

<p>
'Mere musketeers have not status sufficient to arrest a
gentleman of the Scottish Guard;&mdash;we rank with field-officers
of the French line,' said I.
</p>

<p>
'M. Blane forgets that I am noble.'
</p>

<p>
'By marriage with a lady descended from Joan of Arc's
family; but you forget, my dear M. Brissac, that by the edict
of Louis XIII., (whose agreeable warrant you bear,) passed
in 1614, "females descended from <i>La Pucelle</i>, shall no
longer ennoble their husbands," so that heraldic force is at
an end.'
</p>

<p>
'Pardieu! beat him down, messieurs, with the butts of your
muskets, for I am weary of this!' exclaimed de Brissac, with
sudden passion; and finding, on reflection, the danger and
futility of further resistance, I surrendered my weapon, saying,
with a lightness, I was far from feeling,
</p>

<p>
'Here is my spit&mdash;but pray be careful of it, for a dainty
demoiselle's pink glove, is, or should be at the shell of it.'
</p>

<p>
'Little Babette's of the Fleur-de-lis, in the Rue d'Ecosse, I
presume,' said he, scornfully; but as Marion de l'Orme
usually wore pink gloves, he shook with rage, as he thrust me
into the carriage and took his place beside me.  The fiacre
was put in motion; the musketeers ran at a double quick
march on each side of it, which dispelled my first idea that
they meant to assassinate me; and as we drove on, I taxed
my memory in vain for any offence or crime I might have
committed.
</p>

<p>
'Oh&mdash;you are angry at finding me at little De l'Orme's,
perhaps?' said I.
</p>

<p>
'What care I for Mademoiselle de l'Orme?' said he;
'who is her lover now?'
</p>

<p>
'Rumour says a certain M. de Brissac&mdash;but I know 'tis the
young Marquis de Toneins.'
</p>

<p>
'Bah&mdash;her affections are of the most rapid nature!'
</p>

<p>
'Well, my dear M. de Brissac,' said I, in that sneering
fashion which the Parisians were fast teaching me; 'if you
are not jealous of me, you will perhaps have the kindness to
acquaint me with my crime.'
</p>

<p>
'You have been in love with the King's mistress.'
</p>

<p>
My heart trembled at these words; but I resolved to put a
bold face on the affair.
</p>

<p>
'Nay, nay, M. Brissac! she is in love with me.'
</p>

<p>
'Oh, fie, M. Blane!  But no matter; I have known a man
branded with the fleur-de-lis, or sent in chains to the galleys
at Toulon for less.'
</p>

<p>
'Pleasant reminiscences!'
</p>

<p>
'Very; suggestive, too: I hope you like them.'
</p>

<p>
'This arrest is an infamous violation of the privileges of
the Scottish Guard,' said I, losing all temper; 'these
privileges were given us by the predecessors of Louis XIII.&mdash;by
kings better and braver than he&mdash;privileges won in battle, and
which he cannot, dare not revoke!'
</p>

<p>
'Dare not?'
</p>

<p>
'No!'
</p>

<p>
'Peste! do they include the right of intromitting with the
King's mistress?'
</p>

<p>
'King Louis will hear more of this; if he wishes, a town
taken in Lorraine, or a castle stormed on the Rhine.'
</p>

<p>
'Your Scottish government may, if they choose, place a
French gentleman in the castle of Edinburgh, by way of
reprisal,' sneered De Brissac.
</p>

<p>
'That will comfort me mightily.'
</p>

<p>
'I presume there is no lack of French fiddlers and dancing
masters in Scotland?'
</p>

<p>
'There are twenty thousand Scots now under Hepburn and
La Force; I would they were all to-night in Paris.'
</p>

<p>
'The Marechal de la Force is a brave fellow.'
</p>

<p>
'Ay, none is braver.  He will face the devil or a cannon-ball&mdash;'
</p>

<p>
'But he cannot face his angry wife.'
</p>

<p>
'In all things he excels M. de Brissac.'
</p>

<p>
'Thank you; but for the place to which we are going, I
would ask you to alight and measure swords with me.'
</p>

<p>
'Now that you speak of it, where are we going?'
</p>

<p>
'Cannot you guess?'
</p>

<p>
'No; but your musketeers must be well nigh out of breath
by this time.'
</p>

<p>
'We are en route to the Bastille.'
</p>

<p>
'The Bastille!' I exclaimed, while my blood ran cold.
</p>

<p>
'Yes; 'tis occasionally fashionable to visit it at the French
court.'
</p>

<p>
'I would prefer any other prison&mdash;'
</p>

<p>
'The Château d'Amboise, perhaps; but we cannot always
choose our own quarters, M. Blane,' said De Brissac, as the
fiacre, to the great relief of messieurs the twelve breathless
musketeers, halted close by the Porte St. Antoine; and vainly
I recalled the warning of the Marquis de Gordon, when first I
met him at Clara's&mdash;
</p>

<p>
'<i>Be wary, for her chamber has occasionally led to the Bastille,
or to the more dreadful oubliettes of the Louvre!</i>'

<h3>
CHAPTER XXX.
<br /><br />
THE BASTILLE.
</h3>

<p>
When I alighted, the musketeers closed round me.  We were
under the shadow of an immense dark building, the massive
outline of which was broken at intervals by eight round
towers.  A jagged gateway frowned above the carriage;
there was a clanking of iron bars; a horrible jarring of bolts
upon the pavement as an iron gate was opened and shut; a
swinging of chains and exchange of papers as De Brissac gave
my sword to the governor with a malicious and undisguised
smile of triumph; and then I found myself in the custody of
the Bastille&mdash;fairly enclosed within its walls.
</p>

<p>
The Bastille!
</p>

<p>
How much of terror had not that name conjured up within
me; and now visions of dungeons and of sufferings inconceivable
came vaguely before me, as I was requested, with cold
politeness, to 'step <i>this way</i>,' and mechanically I followed, my
heart sinking lower at every step, along passages, vaulted,
dark, and strong, on the slimy or cold and whitewashed walls
of which the torches of the gaolors flared and gleamed; and a
horror came over me, that if I did not reach a pestilential
vault at the end of these devious corridors, some secret plank
or paving-stone might suddenly sink beneath my feet, and
precipitate me, crushed and mangled, into some hideous
oubliette or subterranean tributary of the Seine, where, among
the festering bones of former victims, mine would rot,
unburied and forgotten.  I had often heard of such things; and
was there aught too horrible to be associated with that
edifice?
</p>

<p>
Bastille meant simply an ancient castle; but that of Paris
alone retained the name; though we in some manner adopted
it in Scotland by designating our fortified mansions
<i>Bastel-houses</i>.
</p>

<p>
The terrible Bastille of Paris, begun by order of Charles
V. in 1383 for the defence of the city, was completed by his
successor, Charles the Well-beloved; and since then it had
been the infernal abode of misery and of tears, dedicated
solely to the secret purposes of despotism and tyranny.
</p>

<p>
As we advanced into the interior of its vast and gloomy
keep, I was deeply impressed by the number and complication
of low-browed doorways, steep staircases, and narrow corridors
by which its enormous walls were perforated; and by the
number of huge iron locks, bolts, bars, and chains by which
all the entrances were secured.  At last we crossed a high
and spacious hall, having a roof and floor of stone.  In the
centre stood a square mass of stone-work, having one little
orifice or window, but all cramped and bound together by
bars of iron run into the stone with lead.  It was one of
those terrible cages made by the decrepit tyrant, Louis XI.,
for the confinement of great state-prisoners&mdash;a notable invention
of the Cardinal de Baluc, who was the first to experience
the comforts of them.  The Most Christian King was charmed
by the invention, however, and had several made; thus they
were styled by the lively French, 'the King's little daughters.'  Each
had a door of stone&mdash;a slab like the lid of a coffin;
and none on whom that dreadful door was closed ever came
out again&mdash;alive, at least.  In this vast sepulchral-looking hall
the torches flared and gleamed with a red and smoking light.
</p>

<p>
Rage and hatred began to mingle with my alarm as we
passed from thence along a corridor beyond the hall, and I
was ushered through a Gothic doorway into an apartment.
Then the Captain of the Bastille turned to me, and said&mdash;
</p>

<p>
'M. Blane, this is your chamber and sleeping-place.'
</p>

<p>
I glanced round me.  The room was circular, as it was in
one of the towers attached to the keep.  Its walls were
covered by pale leather stamped over with gilded flowers.  It
had one long and narrow window, having a pointed arch, well
barred without and glazed with stained glass charged with the
arms of France, and latticed with brass wire within.  The
furniture was very plain, but a comfortable fire of wood was
blazing on the stone hearth.
</p>

<p>
'Monsieur's apartment is quite historical,' said the Captain
of the Bastille, with a well-bred smile, which to me seemed
then a hideous leer; 'it was in this place that the Scottish
archer, a Huguenot who was accused of a design to fire the
city of Paris, was tortured to death; and here the Comte
d'Auvergne, son of Charles IX., was confined until 1616.'
</p>

<p>
'Confined&mdash;how long?'
</p>

<p>
'About <i>fifty</i> years, I think, monsieur.'
</p>

<p>
I made no reply, for my tongue seemed cleaving unto the
roof of my parched mouth.  He bowed and left me; and the
clatter of bolts and locks as the door was secured, together
with the sound of retiring footsteps, as the Captain and his
people withdrew, sank like iron into my soul.
</p>

<p>
My bed, which was destitute of curtains, stood close by me,
and I flung myself upon it, exclaiming with bitterness&mdash;
</p>

<p>
'And this is the reward of my service to a faithless King!
Send a fool to France and he will still be a fool&mdash;'tis our old
Scottish proverb, and truly it applies to me.'
</p>

<p>
It seemed almost incredible that the events of the last hour,
or of the past day, were reality; that within so short a
period, I had been graciously received by the King at
Versailles, and had delivered those triumphant despatches which
filled all Paris with joy; that within an hour, I had been in
the gay and brilliant salon of the beautiful Marion de l'Orme,
surrounded by the chief wits of Paris; and now, that I was a
lonely state prisoner, without an accuser and without a crime;
a prisoner, perhaps to remain so in secret during the caprice
of the King; to be handed over, as others have been, from
gaoler to gaoler, from chatelain to chatelain; for my name
a number substituted, until my hair became white, and even my
oldest friends had forgotten that I had once lived and
mysteriously disappeared from among them!
</p>

<p>
These thoughts were bitter agony!
</p>

<p>
I thought of the Countess d'Amboise, and the Marquis de
Gordon; but I had no means of communicating with either of
them, and thus they would remain probably in ignorance of
my situation.  Who was my enemy&mdash;who were my accusers?
I started up and traversed my room to and fro, with impatient
strides, until I grew weary, and again seated myself on the
bed to watch the embers on the hearth as they flickered,
reddened, and died in the uncertain currents of air that came
down the huge chimney, the aperture of which was secured by
an iron grating; and so the long, long night wore away and
the lingering dawn began to brighten over sleeping Paris and
the distant country.
</p>

<p>
I opened the stained-glass casement and looked out.  Far
down below, beyond the outer rampart of the Bastille, I saw
all the chimneys of Paris vomiting smoke; the arsenal of
Henry IV., a spacious pile, having three great courts and a
portal, the pillars of which were cannon set on end.  Beyond
lay the Seine and the Isles of St. Louis and the Cité&mdash;the
Paris of the kings of the first race and of Philip Augustus&mdash;rising
like a mass of rugged castles, moated round by the
river, which was bridged across by the quaint piles of the
Pont de Notre Dame and the Pont de la Cité.  Nearer still,
waved the green trees which covered all the Isle Louviers.  A
yellow flush spread across the eastern quarter of the sky;
above it rolled clouds of murky amber, rendered darker by the
morning smoke; and as the sun ascended behind the horizontal
stripes of cloud, which his rays turned to bars of seeming gold
and fire; he tipped with a rosy gleam the countless quaint
façades and features of the city, which spread around me,
with all its churches, spires, and glittering vanes; and chief of
all, the huge dark double towers of Notre Dame, whose
foundations were laid by Charles the Great.  The queen of
French cathedrals, she rose from a sea of ancient roofs, steep,
sharp, and conical; and there, too, yawned the Parvis, a
handsome old square, overhung by quaint houses, full of
bustling shops, hurrying passengers, and a hundred varying
noises.  Then, as morning advanced, I heard the bells ringing
in all the convents, monasteries, and steeples&mdash;St. Landry,
St. Pierre aux Boeuf, St. Denis du Pas, St. Germain l'Auxerrois,
and all the old churches of Paris as the city awoke, and
roused itself to life and business, prayer and sin.
</p>

<p>
The live-long day, from my lofty perch, I watched far
down below the sights and sounds of Paris passing and
buzzing round me, until the rattle of fiacres and the clatter of
hoofs died away, and the arteries of life that intersected the
town became dark and still as night drew on again, and, with
a sigh of weariness, I threw myself on my bed, to sigh and
pray, and to utter futile imprecations and maledictions on the
hour I came to France.  My gaoler was a kind but taciturn
fellow.  He had served a long apprenticeship to chains and
groans, and to sighs of unavailing anguish; thus he seldom
spoke; yet, when he did, it was only to drop casual hints
of the horrors by which I was surrounded, but quite in a
common-place way, for the man had scarcely an idea of
anything beyond the precincts of the Bastille; and from him I
learned that in this living tomb were state prisoners who had
been committed to it on no better warrant than a lettre-de-cachet,
of which letters any French noble might get a dozen
from the premier any forenoon; prisoners who had not seen
the blessed light of day for more than forty years; poor creatures
whose crimes, if any, had long since been forgotten, even
as their names were forgotten by their keepers, and as their
existence was forgotten by the world; like the dead of forty
years ago; and the whole record of whose mysterious disappearance
from life and upper air, if record of it existed at
all, might be found in some mouldy portfolio of Richelieu or
his predecessors.
</p>

<p>
Such were the inmates of the Bastille!
</p>

<p>
One day I beheld a long train of personages on foot pass
through the gate of St. Antoine.  There were gentlemen
guards, grooms, pages, and lacqueys.  Six of the former bore
a blue-silk canopy over the head of a tall and stately lady, who
was also on foot, and carried in her right hand a lighted
taper.  As she passed along, cries of 'Vive la Reine'
reached me.
</p>

<p>
'What is all this?' I inquired of my keeper, who chanced
to be in my apartment.
</p>

<p>
'It is her Majesty, Madame Anne of Austria, proceeding
on a pilgrimage to the shrine of St. Fiacre, to pray for the
health of the King, who is ill, and to return thanks for her
own cure.'
</p>

<p>
'Cure from what?'
</p>

<p>
'A dangerous issue of blood, which M. Richelieu affirmed
to be the malice of sorcerers, and which had baffled her
physicians with all their skill.'
</p>

<p>
'You believe in all this?'
</p>

<p>
'Parbleu, yes!  If M. Seguier, Bishop of Meaux in 1649,
and Jean, Comte de Blois, bore testimony to the wonderful
cures wrought upon them by praying to St. Fiacre, why
should not a poor unlettered fellow such as I?'
</p>

<p>
'True; this is unanswerable.'
</p>

<p>
'And we all know, monsieur, that M. Bossuet, Bishop of
Meaux, began a <i>novena</i> of prayers to implore the divine
intercession for the Queen, who was thereafter safely delivered of
a boy, who may be Louis XIV. if he lives, yet is as unlike
his father as I am.'
</p>

<p>
'Perhaps you resemble the Cardinal,' said I.
</p>

<p>
'If court scandal is dangerous in the open air, monsieur, it
is much more dangerous in the Bastille,' replied the man,
with a hasty glance around him, as he withdrew.
</p>

<p>
'It is strange,' said I to him on the sixth or seventh day of
my captivity, 'that your face seems familiar to me.'
</p>

<p>
'Perhaps, monsieur,' said he, smiling, 'those who see our
faces here, remember them for ever.'
</p>

<p>
'What is your name?' I asked.
</p>

<p>
'Martin Omelette.'
</p>

<p>
'How? any relation to my maitre d'hôtel, Pierre Omelette?'
</p>

<p>
'Who keeps the Fleur-de-lis, in the Rue d'Ecosse?'
</p>

<p>
'Yes.'
</p>

<p>
'I am his brother, M. Blane, and have had the pleasure of
seeing you, and M. le Vicomte Dundrennan, and other
gentlemen of the Garde du Corps Ecossais, there often.'
</p>

<p>
'Alas! times are changed with me now, my friend Martin;
I am alike poor and unfortunate.'
</p>

<p>
'Take courage, monsieur; you have been here only seven
days.'
</p>

<p>
'D&mdash;n, only seven!'
</p>

<p>
'We have had prisoners here for seven-and-forty, and yet
they have been released at last&mdash;released when their minds
had sunk to such apathy, however, that they would as readily
have remained.'
</p>

<p>
'Martin, you torture me!'
</p>

<p>
'We had one for forty-six years in this very room; see, he
has scribbled the walls all over with invocations of St. Fiacre,
his patron, and the dates will show you an ordinary lifetime
spent within this little place.'
</p>

<p>
'Martin,' said I, in a voice like a sob, 'I should die of
this place in one month.'
</p>

<p>
'So at first they all say who come here; yet they get used to
it&mdash;even those who are secret prisoners, and who, without date
or name, are handed over per list from chatelain to chatelain.
Ma foi! we have one in the lowest vaults who is so old that
he has worn out a set of fetters, and is supposed to have been
put in when M. de Salvaison was captain of the Bastille.'
</p>

<p>
'In what time did this worthy flourish?'
</p>

<p>
'In the days of Henry II.&mdash;about 1560.'
</p>

<p>
'Impossible!'
</p>

<p>
'Seventy-five years ago, monsieur.'
</p>

<p>
'It is alike horrible and incredible!'
</p>

<p>
Martin smiled faintly, and whispered,&mdash;
</p>

<p>
'He is supposed to be a kinsman of Anne du Bourg, whom
the Cardinal de Lorraine, a fierce and passionate man, hanged
and burned in the Place de la Grève; but only supposed,
monsieur, since he never speaks now, and we know not his
name.'
</p>

<p>
As if he had said too much, Martin Omelette hastily withdrew,
leaving me to torture myself with dark anticipations of
the future, and to spell over the prayers with which my
hapless predecessor had supplicated the intercession of
St. Fiacre.  But my mind would recur again and again with
stinging poignancy to my present predicament.  I thought
now of all my futile aspirations after fame; of all I had done
at Bitche, at Ingweiler, and La Mothe, in the service of this
ungrateful Louis of France, whose wanton war against Duke
Charles of Lorraine I saw in all its wickedness.  Then I
thought of my distant home and the scenes I never more
might see; of the green pastoral hills and the woods of
Blanerne, that cast their shadows on the Dee, whose waters
rush to meet the Solway; of the birchen glen, on the brow of
which the towers of old Tungland Abbey raised their gray-worn
pinnacles above the waving coppice; of the breezy
upland slopes, where the yellow corn ripened on the long
golden rigs, where the bonneted ploughboy whistled, nor
dreamed there was such a thing as tyranny in the world;
where the black crow and the eagle that had their eyry in
St. Mark's lovely isle were wheeling aloft, and I panted for
freedom and for <i>home</i>!
</p>

<p>
Home!  Alas!  I had more friends in the grave than in
the world; yet their graves were in Scottish earth, and that
was all the world to me.
</p>

<p>
I thought of my unavenged quarrel with the house of
Nithsdale; of my slaughtered father, as he lay all 'boltered'
in his blood by Lochar Moss; of our ravaged lands and
ruined homes, all sunk in smoke and flame, as I had last seen
the tower of Blanerne when I, a fugitive, looked back from
the green hills of Galloway, and saw the weapons of the
Maxwell troopers glitter on my track, as I forded the foaming
waters of Urr.  Then I thought of the horrors of the Bastille,
and dashed my head upon my bed, as I longed&mdash;madly longed
for liberty!
</p>

<p>
Louis XIII. I abhorred, but could not petition either him
or the Countess d'Amboise, for paper and ink were denied
me.  How had our petty intrigue&mdash;if intrigue it could be
called&mdash;been discovered?
</p>

<p>
I remembered the loss of the miniature at Versailles,
and the malevolent smile of the jealous De Brissac, and
planned a hundred impossible schemes of escape and revenge;
and so, amid all these bitter, burning, and impatient thoughts,
the second weary week of my captivity wore slowly and
monotonously away.
</p>

<h3>
CHAPTER XXXI.
<br /><br />
'NUMBER 32.'
</h3>

<p>
Perceiving that I was becoming very dull and miserable,
Martin Omelette brought me an old book, which he said had
been left by my predecessor.  It was a manuscript, and was
entitled <i>La Vie de Monseigneur St. Fiacre</i>.
</p>

<p>
'St. Fiacre again!' said I.
</p>

<p>
'Yes, monsieur,' said he, 'and I hope it may serve to
amuse you as much as it amused and consoled the poor
chevalier, who for six-and-forty years&mdash;&mdash;'
</p>

<p>
'Leave me, in the devil's name!' I groaned.
</p>

<p>
'Yes, monsieur,' said Martin, bowing, for he never forgot
his politeness, and withdrew.
</p>

<p>
Mechanically I turned over the leaves and read.  The first
line interested me, and I read on.  It was the quaint monkish
story of an ancient saint, and as this exalted personage, whose
name is now 'familiar as a household word' to the Parisians,
was a countryman of my own, I found some amusement, if I
did not discover consolation, in the volume with which honest
Martin had favoured me.  The history was copiously interspersed
by prayers, pious invocations, and occasional bursts of
wild enthusiasm, for the admiration of the writer&mdash;an old
canon of Notre Dame&mdash;were at times uncontrollable when
writing of the '<i>Glorieux ami de Dieu, Monseigneur St. Fiacre.</i>'
</p>

<p>
'The 30th of August is the anniversary of St. Fiacre,' began
the volume, 'son of Ewen IV., king of Scotland, who began
his reign in the year of our Redemption 605&mdash;a king who was
educated, as the Black Book of Paisley saith, piously and
carefully, under St. Culme, the abbot of Iona, by whom he
was reared in all manner of human learning, and in the love
of God in works of piety; yet he swerved from the precepts
of his peaceful master, by being grievously addicted to war, as
the king of Strathclyde and the half-savage Saxons then
inhabiting the land now called England found to their cost, in
many a battle fought and lost between the Tyne and Humber.'
</p>

<p>
Then the old legendary proceeded to tell us how Fiacre, the
son of Ewen and his queen Frivola of Ross, was born in
Dunstaffnage, and educated by Conan, Bishop of the Western
Isles; and how he proved a brave, valiant, and virtuous
prince: till once, when hunting on the wild shores of the Bay
of Nigg, a strange adventure befel him.
</p>

<p>
Near a fountain, at which his horse was drinking, he saw a
maiden of more than mortal beauty, with snow-white skin and
golden hair&mdash;the spirit of the water.  This was on the 30th
of August, the festival of St. Rose of Lima.  Of this
spirit-woman he became deeply enamoured, and was wont to meet
her again and again in the mirk hour, between midnight and
morning, until he who sought to give her a human soul was
in danger of losing his own, for the spirit was a fiend, who
sought the youth's destruction; but Saint Fergus, the Bishop
and Confessor, whose cell was hewn in the old craig of Inverugie,
and whose right arm is now preserved in the cathedral of
Aberdeen, besought the Prince to abandon the fountain,
which he blessed and purified, by saying a solemn mass
on the spot, after which the spirit appeared no more; but
that fountain is still named St. Fiacre's Well, and is famous
among the northern peasantry for the miraculous cures
accomplished by its waters.
</p>

<p>
After this, full of gratitude to Heaven for his narrow escape
from perdition, Fiacre became a preacher, and renouncing his
sword and buckle, his high estate and place, he quitted
secretly, in the night, his royal home, among the dark
mountains of Lorn, and became a teacher and preacher of the
gospels.  Visiting France when Clotaire II., son of the
infamous and lewd queen Bredegonda, was king, he proceeded
throughout all the land, leading the wild Franks to God, and
working marvellous miracles by the way.  At Toppaia, in
Florence, he delivered a certain rich man of a devil which
possessed him, but which immediately possessed his wife,
who thereupon became frantic, and hanged herself upon an
orange-tree.  In memory of this riddance&mdash;whether of
the wife, or the devil, or both, the chronicler doth not
say&mdash;the rich man founded a chapel in honour of St. Fiacre,
and the Dukes of Florence have since endowed and adorned it
nobly.
</p>

<p>
The legendary then proceeded to state how St. Fiacre was
assailed from time to time by the beautiful spirit of the
fountain, which appeared to him, ever and anon, from the waters
and wayside wells near which he passed, for he lived in forests
and lonely places, subsisting on roots and herbs; and thus he
resisted more temptations than ever did honest St. Anthony of
old: and now, when his father, king Ewen, died in Lorn, in
622, as Camerarius and Bishop Leslie tell us, St. Fiacre was
visited by a train of chiefs and priests from Scotland,
summoning him to the throne; but he answered, that 'for the
inheritance of an eternal crown, he had renounced all earthly
claims,' and, turning away, continued the task at which they
found him&mdash;covering the roof of his hut with turf.  So his
brother Ferquhard was chosen, in his place, King of Scotland,
a prince who fell into the Pelagian heresy, and fought with his
nobles, who threw him into a prison, where he perished
miserably by casting himself upon his own sword.
</p>

<p>
Meanwhile, St. Fiacre lived in peace at his solitary cell, in
a deep forest at Brieul, in Brie, where a place had been
assigned him by St. Fars, Bishop of Meaux.  There, with his
own hands, the pious prince cleared the ground of its old
primeval oaks and sharp briars, and there he built a chapel to
the Virgin, where he gave to prayer the hours that were not
spent in the cultivation of his little garden, the proceeds of
which he gave to the poor.  There he died on the 30th of
August, the feast of St. Rose, in the year 670, and there he
was buried.
</p>

<p>
Thereafter, for ages, his shrine was visited by crowds of
pilgrims from all parts of France; till the 30th of August,
eight centuries after, when a spring of pure water suddenly
burst up from the chapel floor, and the monks of Meaux,
recalling the legend of the spirit of the fountain which had
tormented the saint of old, translated his relics to their
cathedral in 1562; and the name of <i>Fiacre</i> was first given to
hackney-coaches in Paris, because these vehicles were greatly
used by sick and infirm pilgrims who visited the shrine of the
Scottish saint, for which they usually set out from the hotel
of Maître Nicholas Sauvage, which bore the sign of St. Fiacre,
and stood in the Rue St. Martin, opposite to the Rue de
Montmorenci, where it swung in the wind until 1645.
</p>

<p>
My hapless predecessor had probably, nay I have no doubt
must have been one of those who adhered to the ancient faith,
otherwise he could not have drawn much comfort from this
old monkish story.  I yawned over it wearily, and in all the
prayers to, and pious invocations of, St. Fiacre, trusted less
than to the virtues of a rope ladder, a sharp dagger, and a
brace of loaded pistols.
</p>

<p>
An occasional leaf of the <i>Mercure Française</i>, which I
received wrapped round bread, butter, or fruit, acquainted me
with the progress of events in the great world without, and
thus I Learned that war was still waged against Charles IV. of
Lorraine, that his daughter Marie Louise was still lurking
undiscovered in Paris, in spite of rewards offered for her
capture; and I learned, too, that my noble comrades of the
Guard&mdash;how I longed to be with them!&mdash;were still under
Hepburn, who, on the 19th of December, with a train of cannon,
and six regiments of infantry, three of which were
Scots&mdash;viz., his own, Ramsay's, and Lesly's&mdash;and with seven
squadrons of horse, had boldly crossed the Rhine, repulsed
the Imperialists, and captured Mannheim, thus securing the
passage of the whole French army, under the Duke de la
Force; that after this he had relieved the Swedish garrison
in Heidelburg, and again destroyed the proud Imperialists
before that magnificent electoral fortress.  Then from another
stray leaf I learned how, by one brilliant charge, the
cuirassiers of the Garde du Corps Ecossais, led by the Marquis
de Gordon and Sir John Hepburn, had completely swept the
Germans from the valley of the Neckar.
</p>

<p>
My brave comrades! who among them were now alive,
and who were slain?  In fancy they all came before me, that
brilliant line of horsemen&mdash;old Patrick Gordon with gray
locks, and eagle eye; the fiery Sir Quentin Home; Viscount
Dundrennan, so handsome and gay; Tushielaw, and Raynold
Cheyne of Dundargle; the brilliant Chevalier Livingstone
d'Angoulême, and other Scottish hearts, all charging holster
to holster, and bridle to bridle!
</p>

<p>
These achievements made my breast swell with agony, and
pant with impatience.
</p>

<p>
The Marquis d'Aytona was so repeatedly baffled by Hepburn's
flying column, that the Emperor of Germany, reflecting
on his lack of skill, put his finger on a part of the map, saying,
</p>

<p>
'You ought to have anticipated him, by crossing the Rhine
there.'
</p>

<p>
'True,' replied the Marquis; 'but your imperial finger is
not a pontoon bridge, and Hepburn, with all his devilish Scots,
are not here to cut it off.'
</p>

<p>
When the last tidings left the army of Lorraine, (as I
learned from the envelope of my butter for breakfast,)
Hepburn with his regiment of Scots, eight thousand strong, the
Cardinal Duke de Lavalette, and Bernard Duke of Saxe
Weimar, were besieging the strong town of Elsace-Zaberne,
which was expected daily to capitulate; and in the assault of
which Lieutenant-Colonel Robert Hanna of Kirkdale, and
other gallant Scots, had left their bodies in the breach.  I
learned, too, how the government of Louis XIII. watched with
growing interest the expected war between England and
Scotland, for France yet held&mdash;or pretended to hold&mdash;to her
ancient alliance with the latter.  As a proof of this, in 1626,
during the quarrel which brought Marshal Bassompierre to
England, when the British merchant ships were suddenly
seized in all the ports of France, those of Scotland, on
hoisting St. Andrew's Cross above the Union flag, were at once
released by the French admirals, and stood out to sea.
</p>

<p>
These scraps of the French Mercury, which told of politics,
war, and battle, and of all the busy life that was still
revolving round my silent and solitary prison, were to me a
far greater source of interest than the musty miracles of
Monseigneur St. Fiacre.
</p>

<p>
Poor Martin Omelette had now become rather friendly to
me, and this served to lighten the tedium of my confinement,
but when I hinted at a bribe, and strove to tempt him about
winking at an escape, he was wont to smile, shrug his
shoulders, and say,
</p>

<p>
'You are brave, M. Blane; but wealth and bravery, like a
long sword and a long purse, seldom go together.  You cannot
offer me aught that would compensate for the loss of my
head, by the executioner's sword, in the Place de la
Grève&mdash;no&mdash;no!'
</p>

<p>
So months wore slowly, heavily, and miserably away.
They seemed a long, long unmarked lapse of time, for nothing
broke the monotony to me.  I had ceased to reckon days and
weeks; but I knew that the spring of 1635 was passing into
summer, and I began to fear my poor heart would burst in its
throbbings after freedom and my home!
</p>

<p>
All I thought, and all I endured, in those long days and
dreary nights, are known only to God and to myself.  I had
ceased to have a name, or existence.
</p>

<p>
I was simply NUMBER THIRTY-TWO in the accursed Bastille!
</p>

<p><br /><br /><br /></p>

<p><a id="chap32"></a></p>

<h3>
CHAPTER XXXII.
<br /><br />
HAPPINESS.
</h3>

<p>
One night I had fallen into an uneasy slumber, and without
undressing lay on my bed untrimmed and unshaven, for I was
fast becoming careless of an existence so monotonous.  As
usual, I was dreaming of freedom and of home, and I saw the
broad blue Dee sweeping on its course, past the old turreted
stronghold of the Maclellans; I saw St. Mary's Isle, with all
its waving woods and ruined pinnacles of the monkish times;
I heard the bell of St. Cuthbert's ancient kirk, as it jangled
in its spire of stone, and the notes of the mavis and merle,
as they soared aloft with wings outspread on the glittering air;
and I seemed to feel the pure breeze that came from the
purple muirlands, laden with the perfumes of the blooming
heather, and the golden broom; all&mdash;all spoke to me of home,
my native land, and I wept in my sleep with joy.
</p>

<p>
'<i>Number thirty-two!</i>' cried a voice.
</p>

<p>
Suddenly a light flashed into my eyes, and I awoke.
Martin Omelette stood before me, bearing a lamp, and in the
shadowy background were two female figures masked and
muffled.
</p>

<p>
'Pardon, monsieur,' said Martin; 'but here are two ladies
who bear an order to the Governor of the Bastille, permitting
them to visit you; so I shall set down the lamp, and wait
outside.'
</p>

<p>
He bowed and withdrew.
</p>

<p>
As he did so one of my visitors removed her mask, and I
recognised the Countess d'Amboise, with her bewitching eyes,
her full white bosom displayed as much as ever, her charming
embonpoint, her grace and winning sweetness.  A golden
tress which escaped between the broad hat and mask of her
companion acquainted me that she was the attendant Nicola
the little Lorrainer.
</p>

<p>
Clara d'Ische certainly looked dazzling, and her dress was
magnificent; yet I gazed at her coldly, for I remembered,
that with all her powerful interest she had allowed me to pine
a prisoner for months in the Bastille.
</p>

<p>
'Alas!  M. Arthur, have you nothing to say to me?'
</p>

<p>
'Yes, madame&mdash;this visit is most welcome&mdash;for save the
voice of honest Martin my gaoler, no other has broken the
solitude of this chamber for months.'
</p>

<p>
'Poor Monsieur Blane!' said the soft voice of Nicola.
</p>

<p>
'You knew that I was here, I presume, Madame la
Comtesse?' said I, with some asperity.
</p>

<p>
'I knew that you were arrested&mdash;'
</p>

<p>
'Indeed&mdash;I thought so.'
</p>

<p>
'Arrested,' she continued, her hazel eyes flashing, 'when
coming from the house of the base courtesan De l'Orme, in
the Rue de St. Jacques.'
</p>

<p>
'I merely visited Mademoiselle de l'Orme to deliver six
letters from the camp.  On my honour I had no other purpose.'
</p>

<p>
'Keep your own secrets, Monsieur, they are nothing to
me.  I might have had you released within a week, had I
chosen.'
</p>

<p>
'But you did not choose it, madame?'
</p>

<p>
'No.'
</p>

<p>
'Alas!&mdash;it was very cruel of you.  Had any one told me
that I should have lived in this place so long without my heart
breaking I could not have believed it.'
</p>

<p>
The Countess gazed at me fully and pitilessly; but little
Nicola cast down her soft eyes sadly as I spoke.
</p>

<p>
'And was my visit to the Rue de St. Jacques my sole
crime?' I asked furiously.
</p>

<p>
'It was not.'
</p>

<p>
'Then madame will perhaps have the kindness to inform me
whether I am indebted to the King or to M. de Brissac for
my quarters here?'
</p>

<p>
'To Louis of France himself.'
</p>

<p>
'But he was most gracious to me when I delivered my
standard and the despatches.'
</p>

<p>
'He who knows not how to <i>dissemble</i> knows not how to
reign,' said the Countess, smiling again; ''tis an old regal
proverb&mdash;but at that moment the King was in no way
incensed at you.'
</p>

<p>
'My crime&mdash;my error, Countess,' said I, angrily; 'to the
point, madame.'
</p>

<p>
'You fell asleep on the terrace at Versailles, M. Blane, under
an elm-tree.  The King passed near you, and saw the miniature
of a lady openly suspended from your neck.  He loves pretty
women after his own maudlin fashion, and curiosity prompted
him to draw near.  He recognised my features, and then
jealousy urged him to send you here, where, but for me, you
might remain with many others until France hails as Louis
XIV. the infant son of Anne of Austria; and I fear that
your black, curly hair would be silvery enough by that time,
my dear M. Blane.'
</p>

<p>
'I should attempt to escape, or perish!'
</p>

<p>
'Escape!&mdash;for what purpose?'
</p>

<p>
'To return home.'
</p>

<p>
'Home&mdash;poor M. Blane, you forget&mdash;'
</p>

<p>
'True, madame,' said I, clasping my hands; 'alas! proscribed
and expatriated, I dare not; but I can turn my steps
to Holland.'
</p>

<p>
'To make love to clumsy vrows, and Dutch dairy-maids
with coarse red fingers&mdash;to learn the mysteries of
cheese-making and tulip-rearing?'
</p>

<p>
'No, madame! to fight against France, perhaps&mdash;to serve
under the banner of the Scottish Brigade.'
</p>

<p>
'Hush&mdash;if you value life!'
</p>

<p>
'And so this was all my mighty crime&mdash;my error!'
</p>

<p>
'Nay, you also committed another most grievous one.'
</p>

<p>
'Indeed!  I am all attention,' said I, bitterly.
</p>

<p>
'You delivered your despatches to the King instead of the
Cardinal.'
</p>

<p>
'Heavens, madame! the despatches from the army were for
the eye of Louis alone.'
</p>

<p>
'So are his Majesty's love-letters&mdash;yet his Eminence
contrives to receive and read them all first.  Then why not a
mere despatch?'
</p>

<p>
'How many wheels revolve within each other at this
wretched court of France!' I exclaimed.
</p>

<p>
'You were justly punished for your falsehood to me,' said
the Countess, with one of her most seductive smiles, and an
artful droop of the eyelid; 'for I will not understand all about
your visit to the Rue de St. Jacques.  But listen,' she added,
laying her soft, pretty hand engagingly on mine: 'his Majesty's
private ring has opened up to me every avenue of this terrible
chatelet, to the governor of which he had previously sent
M. de Brissac with instructions that I was to be obeyed in all
things&mdash;hence I am here, to free and to forgive you.'
</p>

<p>
'Ah, Madame d'Amboise!' I exclaimed, kissing her hand
with a greater burst of joy than gratitude at this delightful
intelligence, 'my heart, my life, my sword are yours from this
moment.'
</p>

<p>
I heard a sigh behind me, and turning, met the timid blue
eyes of Nicola.
</p>

<p>
'Dear Mademoiselle Nicola,' said I, taking her hands in
mine (and plump, warm little hands they were), 'I have
thought of you and your kindness to me often, very often, in
my loneliness here.'
</p>

<p>
I dared not kiss her pretty hands before the Countess; for,
with all her loveliness, Nicola was but a waiting-maid; yet
there was a difference in the manner and style of these two
women that impressed me, and gave me occasion for much
grave reflection afterwards.
</p>

<p>
'So, M. Blane, I have come to take you from the
Bastille, whither the unfortunate work of M. Poussin brought
you; and in future, when going to sleep under a tree, pray
take care to button up your pourpoint&mdash;though never again
shall you have a miniature of mine.'
</p>

<p>
'It would be needless; my heart bears all that is
requisite.'
</p>

<p>
'Madame,' said Nicola, impatiently, 'the clock of the
Bastille is striking two.'
</p>

<p>
'Let us go, then,' said Clara, resuming her velvet mask;
and preceded by Martin Omelette and a few other armed
officials, we descended the hateful labyrinth of passages, stairs,
and corridors to the court of the fortress, where the governor,
hastily wrapped in a cloak, stood near the gate to receive the
credentials of my release from the Countess, whose face he
endeavoured, but in vain, to discover through the holes in her
black velvet mask.  He restored to me my sword and belt,
and a fierce and proud emotion swelled within me as I buckled
them on.
</p>

<p>
'When free,' I whispered impetuously to Clara, 'I will no
longer be the slave of a capricious king.'
</p>

<p>
'Have you quite lost your senses, M. Blane!' said she,
placing a hand on my mouth, 'or do you forget the saying of
Catherine de Medicis, that walls may have ears?'
</p>

<p>
'I shall be alike silent and at your service.'
</p>

<p>
'Come with me to Amboise&mdash;the château, I mean.'
</p>

<p>
'But,' said I, spitefully, remembering my former incarceration
in the cabinet, 'what if the King&mdash;'
</p>

<p>
'The King is seriously indisposed; a fever has quite
prostrated him.'
</p>

<p>
'Despite the Queen's pilgrimage to St. Fiacre?'
</p>

<p>
'And the prayers of Ninon's lover, Monseigneur the
Archbishop of Paris&mdash;he is very ill.'
</p>

<p>
'Long may he remain so!' said I, angrily, as I thrust on
my hat, and we heard the gate of that detested prison closed
behind us.
</p>

<p>
The morning air was cold.  The sky was dark, and the
giant mass of that formidable donjon keep frowned gloomily
over us, with all its towers and terrors.  Nicola trembled
and shrunk close to my side.  I trembled, too, but it was
with joy, ardour, and impatience to be beyond the precincts
of that historical prison.  I hurried past M. le Capitaine du
Chatelet, forgetting even to bid farewell to poor Martin, who
had become so attached to me that he actually wept at letting
me go once more into the world; and handing the Countess
and Nicola into a fiacre that awaited us near the Porte
St. Antoine, we were driven rapidly off.
</p>

<p>
All this seemed a dream to me.  Half an hour ago I was
asleep in my chamber in the Bastille, and now I was whirled
through the dark and empty streets of Paris, past the great
arsenal, the Isles St. Louis and Louvier, and along the banks
of the Seine; the barriers had opened and shut behind us
like magic, for the Countess had obtained the parole from the
captain of the watch, and now we were driving among hedges,
trees, and fields in the open and star-lighted country.  The
hands of the Countess were in mine, and her left cheek rested
on my shoulder.  My heart was full of tumultuous joy, but
not unmixed with alarm, for there were more pleasant positions
in the world than finding oneself the favoured rival of Louis
XIII.&mdash;one who had Bastilles, lettres de cachet, gendarmerie,
mousquetaires of the guard, and the devil only knows all what
more at his command.  Yet I was happy, and, in secret,
sometimes pressed the hand of Nicola, who sat silent in a
corner, and quite in the dark.
</p>

<p>
At last the fiacre stopped suddenly, and we alighted at the
private entrance of the Château d'Amboise, which was
involved in obscurity.  Antoine&mdash;the discreet and invaluable
Antoine&mdash;received us, and in ten minutes after I found
myself in an apartment familiar to me, and locally known as
the Red Chamber.
</p>

<p>
It was completely hung with red amboisienne&mdash;a species of
silk manufactured at the old town of Amboise, in Touraine,
an ancient fief of the former lords of this château, in whose
stronghold, similarly named and situated on the Loire,
Charles VIII. of France died, Louis XI. founded the Order
of St. Michael, and the Guises planned their formidable
conspiracy against the Huguenots in 1560.  The silk in the
chamber was old and faded; but could it have spoken, it
might have told me of a terrible story, for within its four
walls was done a dreadful crime.  Here perished Monsieur of
France in 1471, and with him a lady whom he loved with all
the devotion of chivalry.
</p>

<p>
'Monsieur adored,' says the quaint historian of France, 'a
daughter of the Lord of Monsoreau, and widow of Louis
d'Amboise, who had for confessor a certain Benedictine monk,
named Jean Favre Versois, abbot of St. Jean d'Angely.
This wicked monk poisoned a very fair peach, and gave it to
that lady, who, at a collation, put it to steep in wine, and
presented one half to the prince, while eating of the other
herself.  She, being tender, died in a short time; but the
prince, being of a more robust nature, sustained for some time
the assault of the venom, but could not conquer it, and in the
end, yielded up his life thereto.' (<i>De Mezeray</i>, fol., 1683.)

<h3>
CHAPTER XXXIII.
<br /><br />
IN WHICH I BECOME AN ABBÉ.
</h3>

<p>
Next morning we were seated at breakfast in the secret
boudoir&mdash;that charming little room in which I had first seen
the Marquis de Gordon; the Countess was brilliantly attired
as usual, and the richness of her dress greatly enhanced the
beauty of her fair and ample person.  Her eyes shone with
unusual lustre, for she had just bathed them in perfumed
water; her cheeks had the slightest tinge of rouge; and I
thought that I had never seen a finer or a lovelier woman.
But she had cost me seven months in the Bastille; and though
full of bitterness against Louis XIII., and irresistibly
attracted towards Clara, I resolved that nothing more should
delay my departure for the army; and on my mentioning this,
Madame, notwithstanding all the love-making that had passed
between us, offered so little objection, that I felt piqued, and
soon discovered that while I was fighting in Lorraine, she had
cast her bright roguish eyes on some one else; and this some one
I eventually discovered to be the gallant Comte de Treville,
captain of the king's musketeers.  However, Clara was very
cautious not to give me the slightest reason for suspecting
this, though I heard from her all the gossip of Paris during
breakfast, and all the court news, of both of which important
branches of knowledge I was as ignorant as if I had just
arrived from the realms of Prester John.
</p>

<p>
'To rejoin the army, my dear Arthur,' said the Countess,
caressing my curly head with patronising kindness, 'you will,
of course, require money?'
</p>

<p>
'Peste!  my dear Countess, I should think so.'
</p>

<p>
'Of course, every one requires money, and you cannot be
singular in that respect.  Here is a purse full enough for
your purpose.  These are louis d'ors and rose-nobles.'
</p>

<p>
'The best nobles at the court of France.'
</p>

<p>
'Decidedly!'
</p>

<p>
'Ah! madame, you overwhelm me with kindness.  How
can I repay you for these many favours?'
</p>

<p>
'By carefully obeying me, and fulfilling the tasks assigned
you by the King and myself.'
</p>

<p>
'Speak, madame.'
</p>

<p>
'From the King, you will convey to M. le Chevalier
Hepburn, Marechal de Camp of the Scottish troops, this
letter and this case, both sealed with the royal arms of France.
These you will place in his hands, before Elsace-Zaberne, which
he is now besieging, and which my old friend, Colonel
Mulheim, a Lorrainer, is sure to defend until you reach the
banks of the Sarre.  These from Louis XIII.'
</p>

<p>
'And what from yourself, dearest Countess?' said I,
taking her soft hands in mine and gazing earnestly, perhaps
tenderly, into her fair hazel eyes.
</p>

<p>
'You know my attendant, Nicola?'
</p>

<p>
'Yes.'
</p>

<p>
'Well; as a Lorrainer, the poor girl is no longer safe in
Paris; for the same edict by which Cardinal Richelieu is
about to enrol fifty-two thousand men for the recapture of
La Chapelle, Bohain, and Corbie, which the Spaniards have
stormed from those dolts the Picards, orders the immediate
arrest of all Lorrainers and Alsatians in Paris.  Now poor
Mademoiselle Nicola is from Nanci&mdash;which is her misfortune,
but not her fault.'
</p>

<p>
'And how about yourself&mdash;your own safety?'
</p>

<p>
'Though Louis is ill&mdash;all but bedridden at present&mdash;my
position is secure.  Nicola is but a waiting-maid.'
</p>

<p>
'But dangerously beautiful.'
</p>

<p>
The expressive eyes of the Countess became severe and
disdainful.
</p>

<p>
'She is faithful and attached to me, poor little creature;
yet I can evade the Cardinal's edict no longer.  She is a
woman, a girl rather, without a legitimate protector, and you
are a gallant chevalier.  To conduct her to her parents at
Nanci must be your task.'
</p>

<p>
'Mine!' I exclaimed, with growing astonishment.
</p>

<p>
'Yours.  So I trust, not to your love for me (that I have
ceased to believe in) but to your honour, that you will convey
her in safety to the gates of Nanci, which you will pass en
route for Elsace-Zaberne&mdash;and that you will there leave her,
without question or query.  You promise?' she demanded,
fixing her bright and piercing eyes keenly upon me.
</p>

<p>
'On my honour, Countess,' said I, laying a hand on my
breast; 'impatient as I am to leave Paris, to rejoin the
Scottish Guard, and to deliver to Sir John Hepburn his
despatches, and the baton he has earned so well, I shall not
think of playing the lover or the loiterer on the road.'
</p>

<p>
'C'est bon!  I trust Nicola entirely to your honour and
to her own discretion.  Horses are provided&mdash;I have sent
for your old nag Dagobert, and you will leave this in an
hour.'
</p>

<p>
'So soon!' said I, kissing Clara's hand, and feeling
something of my old love for her reviving.
</p>

<p>
'Yes&mdash;so soon.  Moreover, if you execute faithfully and
honourably the trust I repose in you, namely, to see this poor
girl to the gates of Nanci, my favours will not cease with our
separation.  I have written to my dear old friend,
Monseigneur le Duc de Lennox, who is now at his castle of
Tarbolton, and Cardinal Richelieu by the King's command&mdash;a
command issued at my request&mdash;has written to the
Scottish minister at Edinburgh, Sir Archibald Acheson of
Glencairn, also in your favour; and thus if you obey me with
fidelity, your estate of Blanerne and all your father's offices of
Bailiewick and Captainrie shall be fully restored to you, and
you will be free to return home, unless,' she added, with one
of her old coy glances, 'you find attractions greater in
France.'
</p>

<p>
'Madame, I have no words to thank you! but will the
Cardinal be successful?'
</p>

<p>
'Can you doubt it?  Mon Dieu! it is but a small request
to make of this sieur Acheson, and the Scottish government,
after the late release of all their ships, when those of England
were detained and sold at Havre, Brest, and Calais.'
</p>

<p>
The arrival of a visitor, whose gilded carriage preceded by
two liveried valets, powdered, armed and mounted, halted
under the <i>porte cochère</i>, cut short the reply I was about to
make, and the Countess, after permitting me to give her a
farewell kiss, consigned me to the care of Antoine, bidding
me adieu with a kindness which showed that though she
meant to discard, she had no intention of forgetting me
entirely.
</p>

<p>
Antoine brought me the dress of an abbé&mdash;the usual
costume of a gentleman when travelling at that time; and
under the cassock I placed my belt, with a pair of loaded
pistols and a good dagger; while a pair of petronels were to
be slung at my saddle-bow.
</p>

<p>
'Mademoiselle Nicola,' said Antoine, introducing the
Countess's attendant, whom in her new costume I had some
difficulty in recognising.  She wore a dark religious dress,
with a little hood and wimple, a long veil, and a large cross.
The demureness of her appearance contrasted forcibly with the
youth and exceeding beauty of her face, and the luxuriance of
her bright golden hair.  Her complexion was pure; her lips
a divine coral hue, and her features were cast in the purest
mould of form.  Her loose sleeves revealed the whiteness of
her arms, and gave her hands a smallness almost infantine
as she approached, and with great frankness held both out to me,
while her upward glance was timid and earnest, but confiding.
</p>

<p>
'Welcome, Nicola,' said I, closing the last button of my
long and sombre cassock; 'it seems, my dear little daughter,
that we are about to set out on our travels together, as a nun
and an abbé.'
</p>

<p>
'Yes, monsieur,' said she, with a slight blush, as her long
brown eyelashes drooped; 'and I trust we shall conduct
ourselves with due religious gravity and&mdash;propriety.'
</p>

<p>
'Do not doubt it.  I am an abbé of some place unknown;
but you, I presume, have some order to claim?'
</p>

<p>
'Oh yes, M. Blane.  This is the dress of the <i>Hôpital des
Soeurs de la Charité</i>, for the relief of the sick and poor,
founded by Father Vincent de Paule, a priest whose life has
been one succession of good deeds, for he has everywhere
founded hospitals for the sick, the aged, and the poor; and
King Louis, by letters patent, has just instituted his new
priory of the Lazarites.  Father Vincent has collected, among
the pious of Paris, one hundred and sixty thousand livres, and
sent them into Alsace and Lorraine, to lessen the misery of
those peasantry who are afflicted by the war, and the presence
of&mdash;'
</p>

<p>
'Such fellows as I, mademoiselle.'
</p>

<p>
'Everywhere he is worshipped as a saint, though not yet
canonised, and my dress of his order will protect me, if the
circumstance of my being his favourite god-daughter will not.'
</p>

<p>
'But, my dear little Nicola, your beautiful voice will be
quite spoiled by the hideous accent of Alsace, where they say
<i>Sdrazpurg</i> for Strasbourg, and so on.'
</p>

<p>
'M. Blane,' said she, looking me full in the face, while
her clear bright eyes filled with emotion, 'if you propose to
continue this spirit of gallantry or banter during our journey,
I shall leave you at the first gate of Paris, and pursue my
way alone.'
</p>

<p>
'Nicola, you are quick as gunpowder; but in what
character do we travel?  Father and daughter?'
</p>

<p>
'No, brother and sister.'
</p>

<p>
'By Jove! a dearer relationship would save trouble
immensely.  Oh, pardon&mdash;pardon me, Nicola,' I added, as
her cheek reddened and her eyes sparkled with anger; 'on
my honour I will offend you no more.'
</p>

<p>
Antoine now announced that our nags were waiting at the
postern, and in half an hour after this we had passed through
Paris together, Nicola mounted on a stout and plainly-trapped
little horse, and I on Dagobert.  About mid-day we
passed the last barrier, and took the road to Meaux, furnished
duly with passports addressed to the various lieutenants du
roi, or deputy-governors, of which every fortified town in
France had one.
</p>

<p><a id="chap34"></a></p>

<h3>
CHAPTER XXXIV.
<br /><br />
MY PRETTY PENITENT.
</h3>

<p>
'This is passing strange!' thought I, as we trotted along the
highway towards Meaux, the cathedral spire of which rose
above the mosses of the ville on the right bank of the Marne;
'here am I, Blane of that Ilk and Blanerne, a Chevalier of the
Garde du Corps Ecossais, and so forth, acting gentleman
usher to a French waiting-maid&mdash;a squire o' the stirrup to a
wandering damsel, and that damsel a soubrette!'
</p>

<p>
And yet, as these irritating and ungenerous thoughts
occurred to me while peeping at my companion from time to
time, I became impressed by the grace with which she
managed her horse, by her youth, her beauty, and loveliness;
and, above all, by a purity of thought and choice of language
in her conversation which convinced me that Nicola was
somewhat better than she seemed; and from some remarks she
let fall, I discovered that her father was a reputable citizen of
Nanci, whom the fortune of war had forced into the ranks of
Duke Charles IV.; that her mother was dead, and her
stepmother, to whom she was returning, disliked and ill used
her.
</p>

<p>
I have said again and again that Nicola was lovely; but as
the hours of our companionship were prolonged, and as we
rode side by sicle between the long green hedgerows, the
blooming orchards and graperies that bordered the banks of
the Marne, and were ripening as the spring grew into summer,
I began to discover new and dangerous graces and attractions&mdash;a
lofty bearing, an enchanting purity, that would have graced
even the vaunted Marie Louise of Lorraine, of whose far-famed
beauty Nicola seemed very proud, and of whom she spoke
a hundred times during our pleasant journey, often ridiculing,
I remember, the manner and character of Wolfgang the
young Count Pappenheim, to whom Charles IV. meant to
marry her.  Thus I began to forget the waiting-maid, in the
little sister of the hospital, and daily took more care of my
toilet, pointing up my moustache, curling my hair, &amp;c., &amp;c.,
striving to appear to the best advantage in her eyes, with what
end I scarcely knew.
</p>

<p>
We passed Meaux, of which the illustrious Bossuet was
then bishop, and rode on, chatting and laughing, and quite
forgetting to visit, in our characters of an abbé and soeur de
la charité, the famous shrine of St. Fiacre.  Ouf! the very
name recals to me the image of Martin Omelette, and that
devilish old historical chamber in the Bastille, from which he
was so loth to release me!  We lodged at a quiet little inn
in the marche, where Nicola's costume, as a follower of
Father Vincent of Paule, won her every respect and attention
from our host, while my moustache and sword obtained the
same from madame the buxom hostess, who soon 'detected the
man-at-arms under my cassock,' as she told me with a smile.
</p>

<p>
A ride of twenty-three miles next day brought us to Château
Thierri, an old town of the eighth century, having a castle of
Charles Martel on a hill overhanging it, and in this direction
we progressed, as I chose a route pretty far to the left of the
main road to Lorraine, being&mdash;for various reasons&mdash;desirous
of avoiding the line of march formerly taken by our army.
</p>

<p>
Here we put up at an auberge, opposite to the house in
which the celebrated De la Fontaine was born.  The people
being old Huguenots, who remembered the wars of the League,
were somewhat crusty, and loth to admit two passengers
attired as Nicola and I were; but a twist of my moustache, and
a display of that which is the most convincing argument in
the modern world and in practical philosophy, money, silenced
all their scruples, and we were immediately accommodated
with apartments.
</p>

<p>
Epernay, where Marechal Biron was killed by a cannon-ball,
was our next halting-place; and there at our inn we saw
a picture of Guilleriz, the famous robber, who built a castle in
the wood of Gralla in Brittany, where, after being besieged
by five thousand men, he was taken prisoner, and broken alive
upon the wheel in 1608.  Now, as Epernay lies only fourteen
miles south of Rheims, I began to perceive that we were
travelling a little too fast, and that the time when I must part
from my delightful companion drew nearer by every hour and
mile.
</p>

<p><a id="chap35"></a></p>

<h3>
CHAPTER XXXV.
<br /><br />
IN LOVE WITH A SOUBRETTE.
</h3>

<p>
'Neither virtue nor vice consists in passive sentiment&mdash;but
in action.'  I remembered this maxim of Marcus Aurelius
Antoninus, and resolved to be actively good, and to thrust
the Countess from my heart for the future; never considering,
at the time I applied this trite saying of M. Marcus to
myself, it was merely the image of Mademoiselle Nicola which
was gradually effacing that of Madame d'Amboise.
</p>

<p>
Propinquity, no doubt, had much to do with this new fancy
which hourly grew upon me; besides, the young heart is
decidedly opposed to existing in a state of vacuum, and loves
novelty and variety; hence, the moment one bright image
passes away, another occupies it; thus as the distance between
the Countess and me increased, the greater grew my interest in
Nicola&mdash;but then, Nicola was only a soubrette!
</p>

<p>
Now as all that lovers say&mdash;but here as yet the love seemed
all on my side&mdash;is deemed very prolix, vapid, and foolish, by
the wise and matter-of-fact people of this world, I will not
attempt to rehearse the various little conversations by which
Nicola and I beguiled the way.  One or two I may insert, as
I know that such conferences are not without interest to the
fairer portion of mankind; and with them I have the honour
to agree in all things.
</p>

<p>
'Mademoiselle,' said I, after a long silence, as we
approached Chalons, 'I am so happy to be with you!'
</p>

<p>
'I am equally glad that Monsieur is pleased.'
</p>

<p>
'How can we ever part, Nicola?  When the time comes,
I shall be the most wretched man in Lorraine.'
</p>

<p>
'A gallant man would have said "in the world,"' she
replied, with a waggish smile; 'but will not M. l'Abbé have
his prayers to attend to?
</p>

<p>
'By Jove! my dear girl, then I shall have to pray in my
helmet and boots, like a bishop of Cahors.'
</p>

<p>
I observed, however, that unless my remarks savoured of
the merest commonplace, of the scenery, the towns we passed
through, or of the war which had cast us so oddly together,
she was usually silent; and whenever I attempted to become
tender or complimentary (and then only with a timidity for
which I could not account), she betrayed a mixture of cloudy
reserve, or quick irritation, which, if not very artful in a
soubrette, were decidedly perplexing to me.
</p>

<p>
She was a singularly seductive girl; and with all my growing
love for her, I began to fear&mdash;I knew not why&mdash;that she
might be playing some deep game with me; and at one time
this idea was strong in me&mdash;the more so when I remembered
the peculiarly artful and intriguing character of the person
who had confided her to me&mdash;the Countess, her late mistress.
Yet when I gazed upon her pure, pale brow, and into her
quiet, deep, and trusting eyes, thoughts that were gentler,
kinder, and more loving filled my heart.  Poor little Nicola!
</p>

<p>
In my attentions to her, as I became more delicate, or
pointed, which you will, the more reserved did she seem, and
the more anxious to hasten on her journey.  This only served
to pique me, to whet my interest and curiosity, and to render
me more perplexed as to her real objects and character; and
I observed at Meaux, Château Thierri, Epernay, and other
places, when we put up at an inn or hostelry, she studiously
secluded herself from me in her own apartment, and pleading
fatigue, whether falsely or truly I knew not, rarely took even a
meal with me; and never appeared until our horses were again
at the door, bridled and saddled for us to resume our
journey.
</p>

<p>
I observed, that whenever I spoke of the Countess, her
cheeks were wont to flush, and her usually gentle blue eyes to
sparkle with an anger which she was at little pains to conceal&mdash;thus
betraying an impatience and irritation very remarkable
in one generally so soft in manner, and gentle in disposition.
</p>

<p>
'Now what may all this mean?' thought I; 'is my little
soubrette in love with me herself, and jealous of the Countess?
Courage, Arthur Blane, and probe this other mystery.'
</p>

<p>
On the road towards Chalons, while traversing one of those
broad and beautiful valleys which intersect Champagne, I
spoke with such unreasonable admiration of Clara d'Amboise,
that tears actually stood in the fine eyes of my companion.
</p>

<p>
'This Countess&mdash;,' I faltered, beginning to deprecate, but
not knowing what to say.
</p>

<p>
'Countess&mdash;silence!' said Nicola, with beautiful scorn;
'speak no more of her, and let me endeavour to forget the
hated companionship and collusion which I had with
her&mdash;circumstances in which the force of political events involved
me.'
</p>

<p>
'Do you speak thus of your old mistress?'
</p>

<p>
Nicola laughed, and then grew angry again.  'My mistress!'
she reiterated; 'my poor M. Blane, you are a very good kind
of creature&mdash;&mdash;'
</p>

<p>
'Mademoiselle,' said I, with a sombre bow, 'I thank you
for your patronage.'
</p>

<p>
'But you know not whom you address, whom you speak
of, or what you say.'
</p>

<p>
'Such a spoiled child it is! we have become suddenly quite
angry on one side, and quite stupid on the other it appears.
But this Countess d'Amboise seems to be quite your <i>bête noir</i>,
Nicola.'
</p>

<p>
'Silence!' said she, becoming angry again, and with her
riding switch giving me a smart tap over the bridle hand&mdash;so
smart indeed that had not my thick military glove protected
me, I must have dropped both curb and snaffle reins.  'Silence,
and say no more of this.'
</p>

<p>
'Of what?&mdash;you quite puzzle me!'
</p>

<p>
'Thank Heaven, yonder are the spires of Chalons!'
</p>

<p>
'You early warned me to beware of the Countess, dear
Nicola.'
</p>

<p>
'Well.'
</p>

<p>
'One night at a gate of the Louvre when I was a sentinel,
opposite the Hotel de Bourbon.'
</p>

<p>
'Do you remember what I said?'
</p>

<p>
'Could I forget anything in which Nicola bore a part?
Well&mdash;I took your advice&mdash;I saw her no more.'
</p>

<p>
'Many thanks for such condescending acquiescence; but
M. Blane will please to remember that he marched from Paris,
as I foretold, next day.  How far are we from Chalons?'
</p>

<p>
'About six miles.'
</p>

<p>
'Thank Heaven!'
</p>

<p>
'Why this thankfulness again?'
</p>

<p>
'Because this hateful&mdash;odious journey will soon be at an
end.'
</p>

<p>
'Hateful?' said I, anxiously.
</p>

<p>
'Yes&mdash;exceedingly so!'
</p>

<p>
'You are weary of me, dearest Nicola,' said I, attempting
to take her whip hand.
</p>

<p>
'Weary of your conversation, at least,' said she, giving a
second switch over the fingers; 'and unless you can find a
more entertaining subject than the beauty, wit, et cetera, of the
French king's avowed mistress, please to speak no more.'
</p>

<p>
I began to fear that I had gone too far; but whence all this
pique?  Did this charming enigma&mdash;this beautiful girl&mdash;really
love me, and feel her little heart swell at the thought of
rivalry?  I could neither answer this question, nor account
for the strange timidity with which her manner infected me.
</p>

<p>
'Pardon me, mademoiselle,' said I, urging Dagobert close
to her side, and venturing to kiss her hand&mdash;and this time the
switch was not raised&mdash;'I will not say more until you address
me.'
</p>

<p>
'Then, you shall be silent long enough, I promise you.'
</p>

<p>
She was evidently in a furious pet; thus we rode in silence
into Chalons, and were then one hundred and three miles from
Paris.  I stole a glance from time to time at Nicola, and to
my great perplexity perceived that she was in tears; but amid
the bustle of Chalons, the examination of our papers by the
suspicious guard at the gate, and my anxiety to find, in a
strange city, a suitable hotel, I could not refer to our past
and peculiar conversation, or to the delightful inferences I
drew from it.
</p>

<p>
Chalons lies between two spacious meadows on the river
Marne, which divides it into three parts&mdash;the town, the isle,
and suburb; and high over all its mansions towered the spire
of St. Stephen.  The streets were wide and bordered by trees;
the ramparts were strong; the ditches deep and broad.  Sir
Andrew Gray, of Broxmouth in Lothian, a veteran Scottish
soldier of fortune, was governor, and his garrison consisted of
two fine battalions of the regiment de Normandie.

<h3>
CHAPTER XXXVI.
<br /><br />
OUR JOURNEY TOGETHER.
</h3>

<p>
We put up at a quiet auberge in the suburbs&mdash;such a place as
I usually chose.  It was kept by a reverend-looking old man,
who told me that he had been a soldier in the wars of the
League, and was the comrade of Nicholas Poussin in
the regiment of the Vicomte de Tavannes.  The moment we
entered this auberge, Nicola, as usual, retired to her chamber,
and on this occasion without even bestowing on me the
sweet smile and farewell bow, or waving to me a kiss with her
pretty hand, according to her usual wont when we separated
for the long hours that must intervene until the morrow; and
this pained me more than I could have believed the coldness
or slight of any girl would do&mdash;especially a girl in her position.
</p>

<p>
That night I was very sleepless and miserable.
</p>

<p>
Love should be pure, true, and humble; for true love, as the
Scripture saith of charity, seeketh not its own; and such, I
hope, was mine for this French girl.  I watched the chamber
where Nicola slept, and listened to her soft breathing through
the door, which was slightly ajar.  I saw the shadow of her
curtained bed thrown by the night lamp across the floor, and
I would have given the world (as the phrase is) to peep in
and see her dear little face as she slept; but if discovered,
the intrusion would have been deemed an unpardonable offence
by one so proud, so pure, and modest as Nicola; so I lingered
without&mdash;listening, watching, and hoping I scarcely knew what.
</p>

<p>
I counted the miles, the days, and hours of our journey,
past and those to come; and reckoned the time at which she
must leave me&mdash;when we would separate, and, too probably,
never to meet again.  This approaching fate greatly enhanced
the delight I felt in the society of Nicola, and I returned to
bed, full of strange thoughts.
</p>

<p>
'Either I am of a singularly inflammable nature,' said I,
while turning restlessly on my pillow, 'or by what magic or
miracle, other than her beauty, does this girl so fascinate me?'
</p>

<p>
I had asked myself this question a hundred times before.
</p>

<p>
Then there was that proud reserve and occasional constraint
of manner, which in a soubrette&mdash;and especially the soubrette
of so gay a beauty as the Countess d'Amboise&mdash;were so difficult
of analysis; and for which, even the peculiarity of our
positions&mdash;a young man and a beautiful young woman,
unwedded and unrelated, travelling thus together, and apart
from all the world, could not entirely account.
</p>

<p>
Why did I not fall in love with this girl in Paris, when I
had a thousand favourable opportunities for entangling her in
one of those countless intrigues which make the sum of human
life there?  Simply, because I had never thought of it when
there&mdash;and our positions were then altogether different.
</p>

<p>
Besides propinquity, which causes half or perhaps nearly
all the love affairs in the world, daily companionship, and the
country, are all peculiarly adapted to develope and foster the
tender passion.  Isolate any two young persons of opposite
sexes together in the country for a short season, and if
they are passably handsome, and their hearts previously
unoccupied, some mysterious principle of animal magnetism
will infallibly draw them nearer to each other, and a very
decided flirtation, if not an actual passion, will be the
result.  Thus, in the country, when wandering with a young
and pretty companion, she will become all the more interesting,
because we see her face and hear her voice alone, without
being contrasted with the faces, voices, or manners of others;
and surrounded by the blue sky, the bright sunshine, the green
fields, or the shady woods, a thousand new charms and graces
that were unheeded before will develope themselves.  Away
from the bustle of towns, camps, and garrisons&mdash;away from
the glitter, gloss, and buzz of life, our thoughts will run, as
it were, all to one focus; imagination gets fuller and freer
play, all the impulses of the heart are more joyous and pure;
and thus a girl on whom we might scarcely have bestowed a
thought had we met her in the bustle of the world, may
become a very divinity, enshrined by a halo of such beauty as
the eye or fancy of a lover alone can see.
</p>

<p>
But Nicola was charming enough to have attracted attention
even amid the court beauties of Louis XIII.; thus it was
very natural to expect that I, in whose protection she
confided, and on whose friendship and honour she relied, should
feel a dangerous interest in her, during our solitary journey
through Champagne and Lorraine to the frontiers of France.
Alas!  I could neither know nor foresee all the bitterness this
growing passion, which I so heedlessly fostered, would yet
cost my heart.
</p>

<p>
At breakfast, next morning, my attention was attracted by
a silver medal which the maitre d'hôtel wore suspended from
his neck by a little steel chain.  It proved to be one of those
struck at Rome by order of Pope Gregory XIII., to eternise
the infamous massacre of St. Bartholomew; and as the existence
of such a memorial is but little known in my native
country, I may as well describe it.
</p>

<p>
It bore the destroying angel, his right hand armed with a
sword; his left arm bearing a cross; below him were several
figures with their throats cut, and around was this motto:
</p>

<p class="t3">
  '<i>Hugonetorwn strages</i>, 1572.'<br />
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
'Were you engaged in that scene of blood?' I asked, with
a lowering brow.
</p>

<p>
'Yes, monsieur, in some manner, I was.'
</p>

<p>
'But that was sixty-three years ago.'
</p>

<p>
'Well, M. l'Abbé, I am just sixty-three years old.'
</p>

<p>
'And you were engaged in a massacre when a year old&mdash;what
a blood thirsty young imp you must have been!'
</p>

<p>
'Monsieur, I was born on the very day of the massacre.
Listen to me.  There was a fleuriste in the Rue de l'Arbre
Sec: does Monsieur happen to know the Rue de l'Arbre Sec,
at Paris?'
</p>

<p>
'Perfectly.'
</p>

<p>
'Ah&mdash;there are always pretty girls there.'
</p>

<p>
'Well&mdash;about your fleuriste?'
</p>

<p>
'In that street, there was one named Jeanette Lavardin,
very pretty and very much admired by all the gallants of
Paris, who frequented her little shop and bought kisses and
flowers; for in those days every cavalier carried a nosegay;
but unfortunately poor Jeanette was a Huguenot; and on the
day of the massacre, after the King's Guards, led by Monsieur
d'O, their colonel, had so barbarously slain the Comte de la
Rochefoucault, who was grand huntsman and hereditary
master of the royal wardrobe, the Marquise de Renel,
Francourt the Chancellor of Navarre, and more than two
hundred other gentlemen, who had sought shelter in the Louvre,
all smeared with blood, and panting for fresh slaughter, they
issued into the Rue de l'Arbre Sec, and murdered Jeanette,
though she sank on her knees, and implored them to save her
life, saying that she was not in a fit state to die.  One
mousquetaire made her promise to be a good Catholic, which she
accordingly promised, and was instantly stabbed by swords
and poignards, to prevent her, as the destroyers said, relapsing
into heresy; and then they departed to seek new victims.
</p>

<p>
'Next day, when the Catholics were throwing all the bodies
into the Seine, they found that the murdered Jeanette in her
death throes had given birth to an infant.  Many persons
were deeply moved by beholding a birth under circumstances
so appalling; others were for throwing "the Huguenot's
brat" into the river with its dead mother; and for that fell
purpose the poor naked youngling was seized by one of
Colonel d'O's soldiers, but was saved by a gentleman of the
Scottish Guard of Charles IX., who threw his velvet mantle
over it&mdash;so this child lived to be a man, and has now the
honour of addressing you.'
</p>

<p>
'A strange and terrible story!' said I: 'and this gentleman
of the Scottish Guard&mdash;'
</p>

<p>
'Was the bosom friend of the King of Navarre&mdash;the
Chevalier Blane.'
</p>

<p>
'My father!' I exclaimed with joy.
</p>

<p>
'Yours, Monsieur l'Abbé!' exclaimed the maitre d'hôtel,
almost embracing me: 'your father! tell me, then, is this
brave chevalier alive?'
</p>

<p>
'Alas, no! he was slain last year in cold blood; but I shall
yet avenge him, if ever I tread on Scottish ground again!'

<h3>
CHAPTER XXXVII.
<br /><br />
A HAUNTED FOREST.
</h3>

<p>
Beyond Chalons we rode for several miles in silence, for
Nicola seemed to be still displeased with me, and I felt a
sadness and irresolution for which I could not account, for this
girl exercised a strange and powerful fascination over me;
but now, a storm which came on suddenly was the fortunate
means of bringing us to a satisfactory explanation, somewhat
after the fashion of the regal lovers in the Æneid, save that we
conducted ourselves with much more propriety than Dido and
her demigod.
</p>

<p>
About dusk we found ourselves somewhere on the borders
of Lower Champagne, near a large forest, amid the dingles of
which we had lost the right path; and now the darkening
clouds, with the oppression of the atmosphere, forewarned us
of what was approaching.  No house or village appeared in
sight; every way the forest tracks seemed to be lost in a
wilderness of trees.  On a rock overhanging the forest stood an
old castle, at which we expected to find shelter or a guide;
but it proved to be a roofless ruin, destroyed probably in the
wars of the League: and two or three men, whom we had seen
lurking near it, disappeared on our approach, and accorded no
response to my shouts.  This suggested the unpleasant idea
of robbers; and my hitherto brave little companion grew pale
as the darkness increased, and I carefully examined the pistols
in my girdle and the petronels at my saddle-bow.
</p>

<p>
In her anxiety Nicola forgot her displeasure, and prattled
and spoke to me again, keeping her horse close to my stirrup;
for every minute my hand was required to catch her bridle, as
the brambles and stones rendered the animal restive and liable
to stumble.
</p>

<p>
Once a wolf bayed near us, and she uttered a faint scream.
The French forests were full of those animals.  De Mezeray
tells us that, in 1437, wolves occasionally darted through the
city barriers, and devoured children in the Rue St. Antoine
at Paris; and all the world knows of 'the terrible wild beast'
which appeared in the forest of Fontainebleau and ate one
hundred and forty persons alive, before it was killed by M. de
Brissac and twelve of the king's musketeers.*
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p class="footnote">
* So lately as 1765, the forest of Soissons was full of wolves.  A
ordinance of Henry III. directed the lords of manors to have a general
hunt every third month.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
'Do not be alarmed, dear Nicola,' said I, 'for I have four
bullets and my dagger at your service.'
</p>

<p>
'These will avail you little, M. Blane, against a herd of
wolves.'
</p>

<p>
'Well&mdash;a herd might, perhaps, prove rather troublesome!'
</p>

<p>
'Or a band of robbers&mdash;like those of Guillirez!'
</p>

<p>
'The devil!  My dear mademoiselle, do not think of such
things: yet I would rather face the robbers than the
wolves.'
</p>

<p>
'Indeed! do you hold your life a thing of little price?'
</p>

<p>
'Nay; I hold it, dear Nicola, exactly at the value your
interest in me gives it.'
</p>

<p>
'A very pretty compliment, M. Blane; but do not press
my hand so, pray: and ah, my heaven! there is lightning
coming to increase our annoyances!  Moreover, this forest is
haunted!'
</p>

<p>
'By what?'
</p>

<p>
'A spectre.'
</p>

<p>
'The deuce, mademoiselle! a real spectre?'
</p>

<p>
'Yes.'
</p>

<p>
'Come now, Nicola!'
</p>

<p>
'A tall, lean, ghastly man with a dreadful visage.'
</p>

<p>
'With wolves, robbers, and spectres for companions&mdash;a
dark forest, rain, thunder, and wind&mdash;we shall pass a pleasant
night! now the torrent begins to patter on the leaves! my
poor little Nicola, you will be quite drenched.'
</p>

<p>
'Mon Dieu! it was in this forest that Charles VIII. of
France was warned of his approaching death,' whispered
Nicola, shuddering.
</p>

<p>
'Warned&mdash;by what?'
</p>

<p>
'The spectre&mdash;the demon who haunts it.'
</p>

<p>
'Ouf! we are to have a demon too!  How came it to
pass?'
</p>

<p>
'Charles VIII. was marching home from the conquest of
Naples, and was passing through this wood, accompanied by
Anne of Brittany his queen, and the Lady Beaujeu his sister,
when suddenly a tall and ghastly form like a skeleton, having
a long white beard and enormous red eyes, started from
among the bushes, and grasped the royal bridle, exclaiming
with a shrill voice, like the whistling wind&mdash;
</p>

<p>
'"Stop!  O King, whence go you?"
</p>

<p>
'"To Paris!" answered Charles, boldly; "but why?"
</p>

<p>
'"Because you are betrayed&mdash;beware of the orange-tree!"
replied the spectre, and vanished, for no trace of him could be
found by the King or his company.  Charles therefore became
alarmed, and tarried till all the Scottish Guard, under the
Lord Bernard Stuart d'Aubigne came up, and with these he
passed through the forest in safety; but the terrible visage of
the spectre was ever before him; so that he lost his senses
soon after, and died of a poisoned orange.'
</p>

<p>
Nicola also told me that, in the local superstition of the
peasantry, the forest was the haunt of a malevolent female
spirit known as La Bête Havette, who lived in wells and
springs (like that watery spirit which haunted our friend
St. Fiacre), and was wont suddenly to pour its fury upon
children, drowning them, as the kelpies are said to do in
Scotland.  Here, too, was heard St. Hubert's hunt, when the
yelling of fiendish dogs, the clank of hell-forged fetters, and
mournful cries swept at midnight over the tree tops, and died
away in distance, as the demons bore off the souls of the
damned to punishment; for such the terrified peasantry
believed the passing flocks of wild geese to be; but at last, as
the darkness increased, Nicola became terrified by her own
legends; she ceased to speak, and kept close to my side.
</p>

<p><br /><br /><br /></p>

<p><a id="chap38"></a></p>

<h3>
CHAPTER XXXVIII.
<br /><br />
WHAT HAPPENED THERE.
</h3>

<p>
The darkness of the sky and the denseness of the interwoven
foliage overhead, made our whereabouts so obscure, that our
horses stumbled at every step, till dismounting, I led them by
the bridle.  There was a strange stillness in the air; the rain
fell in large warm drops which plashed heavily on the broad
leaves of the summer forest; the green, ghastly lightning at
times lit up the long dark vistas, glancing for an instant on
the old gnarled trunks, imparting to them a freakish and
grotesque aspect that terrified Nicola, who began to consider
herself rather rash in having rehearsed that very far from
lively historiette or episode in the life of his Majesty Charles
VIII. in such an alarming locality; and as the thunder rolled
and hurtled above us, every moment nearer and more near,
she was all palpitating with terror like a little bird, when I
wrapped my cloak round her, as an additional protection from
the fast falling rain.
</p>

<p>
I now became seriously anxious to find a place of shelter for
her.  A night in the forest, exposed to all the discomfort of a
storm, and to the real and imaginary terrors of such a place,
might prove, I feared, too much for the constitution of a girl
so delicate by nature, and so tenderly nurtured as Nicola
had been.
</p>

<p>
While I was in this state of perplexity, we discovered a
cavern, or deep fissure in a mass of ivy-covered rock close by
us&mdash;the same rock on which the old castle stood.  The bridle
of Dagobert, whose equanimity (never very great at any time)
was rather ruffled by the thunder, I buckled to the branch of
a tree.  Entering, I examined the place by firing my pistol
among some dry leaves, and thus creating a momentary light,
found it to be a complete alcove in the rocks, full of the
withered spoils of the last autumn.  I led in Nicola, placed
her in a comfortable nook, and after securing the horses close
by, in such a manner that to break loose or escape would be,
for them, impossible, I rejoined her; and there we sat, hand
in hand, in that dark rocky chamber, listening to the wild storm
that bellowed without, and watching the gleams of lightning
that flashed and glared on the stems of the summer
forest.
</p>

<p>
I had my pistols at hand, prepared for any emergency;
and making for Nicola a bed composed of dry leaves and our
mantles, I besought her to be composed, and to endeavour to
sleep; but she pressed my hand gently, and declared herself
to be too much alarmed and too excited to think of sleeping;
and there we were alone, at night, in that old haunted forest
on the borders of Champagne.
</p>

<p>
I pressed her dear and tiny hand from time to time, and
occasionally there was a response, which sent a thrill of
happiness to my heart; then she crept closer to my side, for the
darkness was intense, and the uproar of the elements without
was somewhat appalling.
</p>

<p>
As we sat there, the deep, hoarse, solemn murmur of the
wind, as it rose and fell, had in it something very impressive.
At times it wailed like the mingled voices of a vast multitude;
then it chafed among the tossing branches like the
waves of a distant sea, in fierce and sudden gusts; anon it
would die away, and we heard only the hiss of the rain that
poured so ceaselessly down on the leaves of the drenched
forest.  At times strange sounds seemed to mingle with the
passing wind.  I deemed these to be the cries of affrighted
wolves; and often sat pistol in hand, lest some of those
dreadful denizens of the wild should find our place of shelter,
and rush headlong in.
</p>

<p>
The lightning that came in brilliant and quivering flashes
revealed the rugged outline of the cavern-mouth, and the wet
dingles which stretched away in vague and dark perspective;
and the whole scene, with all its concomitants, was so terrible,
that Nicola drew her hood over her eyes, and at times drooped
her forehead on my shoulder.  She was faint with fear, and
weary by fatigue; and, being a good little Catholic, I heard
her muttering her prayers from time to time.  Moreover, she
made a vow, if she escaped all the terrors of the night, to
visit the most renowned shrine in Lorraine, that of St. Lucy
the Scot at St. Michel.
</p>

<p>
Then she uttered a feint cry, and clutched my arm!
</p>

<p>
A thunderbolt&mdash;a blazing ball of fire&mdash;which seemed to fall
with a startling roar, and by its own specific weight, struck at
the mouth of the cavern, a large tree, a strong and ancient
oak, that had stood perhaps for a hundred years, and clashed
it to pieces, cleaving it, like a mighty wedge of flame, to the
roots in a moment.  For a time the sulphureous odour was
stifling; but it subsided at last, and with it the terror of
my trembling companion.
</p>

<p>
'We are quite safe, Nicola,' said I, placing an arm gently
round her.
</p>

<p>
'Safe&mdash;you think so?  Ah!  M. Blane, make a sign of the
cross, just once&mdash;to please me.'
</p>

<p>
'Mademoiselle, in me it were a mockery,' said I; 'for my
forefathers were the first to follow the precepts of the Lollards
of Kyle.'
</p>

<p>
'Then their descendants should make amends, by being the
first to follow mine.  You deem it, as they did, Popish
likely?  What matter how you name it, or they named it;
for, be assured, it is the sign of Heaven: and I shall make
three over you,' said she, waving her pretty hand thrice, in
the dark, across my eyes and brow.
</p>

<p>
'Dearest Nicola!'
</p>

<p>
'If you press my hand thus, I shall take the liberty of
withdrawing it.  St. Ephrem says, Look at the little birds, when
they stretch out their winglets cross-wise&mdash;lo! they straight
ascend towards heaven; but when they fold them, they fall
panting and breathless down to&mdash;where?'
</p>

<p>
'The earth, I presume.'
</p>

<p>
'Yes&mdash;then think of these things.'
</p>

<p>
'Dear Nicola, I can think only of you.'
</p>

<p>
'When you have seen Marie Louise of Lorraine, you will
think of me no more.'
</p>

<p>
'Peste! my dear Nicola, I have no desire to see your
Mademoiselle Marie Louise; nor shall I trust myself near the
dangerous vicinity of her or her people, at least until I
exchange the costume of an abbé for the iron trappings of the
Garde du Corps Ecossais.'
</p>

<p>
'And we shall have parted at the gates of Nanci?' said
she, in a low voice.
</p>

<p>
'Ah, Nicola,' I replied, 'you know not how the anticipation
of that parting wrings my heart!'
</p>

<p>
I sighed, and drew her close and closer still to my breast:
she made no resistance; but I was conscious that she wept
bitterly, and this secret emotion moved me deeply, and
brought my passion to a height.
</p>

<p>
'Nicola,' said I, abruptly; 'will you marry me, dear
Nicola?  Oh, you do not know how much&mdash;how tenderly, I
love you!'
</p>

<p>
'Marry me&mdash;a poor soubrette&mdash;you, a chevalier of the
King's Guard&mdash;one of the proud noblesse of the Guard du
Corps Ecossais!'
</p>

<p>
'Yes&mdash;I, Nicola.'
</p>

<p>
'Oh, monsieur, you must not speak in this way, or think
of such a thing; I am only a poor girl!'
</p>

<p>
'Why?'
</p>

<p>
'What would the army&mdash;what would all Paris, say?'
</p>

<p>
'I will marry you with joy, Nicola, and take you home to
my own dear country.  The Countess&mdash;'
</p>

<p>
'Countess again!'
</p>

<p>
'Pardon me, dearest, I am not about to praise her, but
merely to say that she has promised that through the powerful
interference of Richelieu and King Louis, the cruel act which
proscribes me shall be rescinded; and I know she will keep
that promise.  At home, I have lands, broad acres of corn
and meadow, that lie by the banks of the Dee; I have fell
and forest, a tower and hall, where your merry laugh shall
make the echoes joyous again; and all that I have, with my
heart and love, will I share with you, Nicola,' said I, borne
away by the honest ardour of my passion, and the impulses of
youth.
</p>

<p>
I felt her tremble still more, and her tears fell fast upon my
cheek.
</p>

<p>
'Were I to admit that I loved you, would you be more
devoted to me?'
</p>

<p>
'Impossible!  I could not be more devoted than I now am.'
</p>

<p>
'Oh, silly M. Blane!  I heard you once say nearly the same
thing to that woman d'Amboise.'
</p>

<p>
'No more of these memories, dearest Nicola, or I shall
sink with shame!'
</p>

<p>
'Then let us be silent!'
</p>

<p>
'Nay, nay; say that you love me&mdash;that you will marry me,'
said I, in a whisper; 'speak, Nicola, speak! for this suspense
and silence are torture!'
</p>

<p>
'It may not, cannot be; our ranks in life are unequal, and
our paths lie far apart.'
</p>

<p>
'Love, marriage will make them one.'
</p>

<p>
'Never!' she replied, in a broken voice; 'our paths in life
must, I repeat, lie far, far apart.'
</p>

<p>
'Nicola!'
</p>

<p>
'I am but a poor little soubrette, a penniless girl of humble
origin; and how would your proud Scottish kinswomen, with
all their crests and quarterings, receive me, if they knew of
this?'
</p>

<p>
'It can never be known, Nicola; and as the wife of my
heart, the lady of Blanerne, I can find strong hands and steel
blades enough in Glenkens to force the proudest peer in
Scotland to vail his bonnet to you!'
</p>

<p>
'Force him! and this is one item of the happiness you would
offer me.  That I love you, monsieur,' said she, weeping,' let
these hot tears attest, but cease to speak more of love or of
marriage to me.  Such visions can never be realized; I could
never brook the humiliation you would prepare for me; for I
have much of pride and hauteur in my heart&mdash;albeit, you
deem me so timid, meek, and gentle.  I will strive to be
your friend; but this love I shall conquer, crush, forget
perhaps.'
</p>

<p>
'When?'
</p>

<p>
'When we separate;&mdash;alas!  I cannot hope to achieve this
fatal end while I remain with you.'
</p>

<p>
'No&mdash;no, Nicola!' said I, pressing her to my heart, as the
tenderness and ingenuity of this admission, with the plaintive
softness of her voice, touched me inexpressibly; 'you shall
never succeed in being so cruel as to forget the pleasant days
of our companionship, and the love we have avowed.'
</p>

<p>
'It may be so.'
</p>

<p>
Then there ensued a long pause, and we continued to sit in
darkness and silence, hand-in-hand, our hearts and lips united
as our thoughts; until at last, overcome by agitation and
fatigue, Nicola feel asleep&mdash;asleep upon my breast!
</p>

<p>
Such a strange thing it is, this love.
</p>

<p>
I had met Nicola, and left her; met her again and again, to
leave her, without other thought than that she was beautiful;
she had been nothing to me then; but from the time that love
began to spread its halo round her, she seemed as necessary to
me as the air or the sunshine, yea, as life itself.  We seemed
now to have but one existence, and the marvel to me became,
how had I lived, and breathed, and spent so many years without
her; and without discovering that her place in the world
of my heart had been vacant.  It is very mysterious all this;
but every lover has the same idea, or he is no lover at all.
</p>

<p>
My whole being seemed now inspired by a new joy; and I
no longer remembered how time had passed with me before
this fountain of passion had welled up within our souls with
the first kiss we exchanged in that dark cavern, which, with
all its attendant terrors, had so suddenly brought our emotions
to a crisis: and so passed our night in the old haunted forest
of king Charles VIII.

<h3>
CHAPTER XXXIX.
<br /><br />
WHAT HAPPENED AFTER.
</h3>

<p>
With night and darkness the storm passed away, and, when
morning broke, no trace of it remained but the torn and
twisted branches, the thunder-riven oak, and the diamond-like
dew, that dropped from every leaf, and bowed the laden grass.
Nicola awoke refreshed, but I was pale, weary, and excited:
the livelong night I had not slept, having sat by the side of my
companion, watching and half-supporting her, full of happiness,
and of many thoughts, some of which made me anxious
enough at times.  But I kissed the sleeping eyes of Nicola,
and forgetting all but that she loved me, I proceeded to groom
and re-saddle our poor nags, which had borne the terrors and
discomfort of the past night with all the equanimity of old
troop-horses.
</p>

<p>
Flocks of those little birds of the woodcock species, known
in France as chevaliers aux pied verts, were fluttering about
in the misty swamps and little tarns formed by the torrents of
rain that had fallen overnight; the startled hares and rabbits
bounded from among the wet leaves, and fled before us as we
mounted and set forth from our comfortless billet; and
steering through the forest by the direction of the sunbeams,
sought once more the way which led towards Lorraine.
</p>

<p>
We soon found it, and passing into that hostile province,
left behind us the fertile plains of beautiful Champagne.  Our
first halt was at Vaubecourt, on the left bank of the Aisne:
it is a fief of the princes of Lillebonne, who are a branch of
the house of Lorraine.  Nicola gazed wistfully at the gilded
spires of the quaint château, saying she had friends there, who
would gladly receive her.
</p>

<p>
'But I promised to see you as far as Nanci?' said I, with a
tone of disappointment and anxiety.
</p>

<p>
'True,' she replied, with tears in her eyes; and we rode on
in silence and sadness, oppressed by our own thoughts; for we
were now approaching the place and the day of our final
separation.
</p>

<p>
My heart was perplexed by its mingled joy and sorrow.
How delightful it was to be convinced of the entire love of
this gentle creature, and hear her sweet and winning voice give
me timid assurance of it again and again; but how bitter was
the knowledge that a day was at hand when I should hear that
voice and those assurances no more!
</p>

<p>
In her manner there was a soft tenderness which a lover
alone could detect, and it filled me with delight.  She had so
fully avowed a reciprocity of regard that now I had nothing
more to urge on that point; save, that we should not separate
at Nanci&mdash;for to that parting I looked forward with a sincere
and acute sorrow.  I strove vainly to forget that it overhung
me, and for a time to be happy; for when gazing upon
Nicola, the delightful consciousness of proprietary in that
charming form, and community of sentiment in her affectionate
heart, filled me with exalted and joyous emotions.
</p>

<p>
This love for Nicola, which in me had sprung up so
suddenly, strengthening with intimacy, and the length of our
journey, was the first true passion of my heart, which hitherto
had never known aught of an emotion so absorbing.
</p>

<p>
Never before had the thought of a woman&mdash;of a mere girl&mdash;come
between me and the great desire of my soul&mdash;honour
and fame in the French army; but now I thought only of
Nicola, and of spending my life with her, and for her alone.
</p>

<p>
I strove to study, to estimate my real emotion for her, and
the probable duration of it.  Was this love misplaced?
Reason said it was.  Cold Reason!  Yet I loved her, and
love levels everything; but this passion ran full butt against
a thousand old social (or anti-social) prejudices which had
formed the leading principles, the life, the second religion as
it were, of my family for centuries&mdash;never to wed one of a
blood, or name, or race inferior to their own!
</p>

<p>
Nicola was but a waiting-woman&mdash;the soubrette of the
French king's dissipated mistress&mdash;and yet I loved her with
all the heedless ardour of a boy.
</p>

<p>
Rank and name, pride, prejudice, and pedigree, with all
their old heraldic quarterings and mummery, what were they
to me, but something to lay at the feet of this charming
French girl when I said that I loved her?
</p>

<p>
For some miles of the way Nicola had been very sad; but
something in the spirit of the above paragraph, which I had
infused into my conversation, raised her spirit, and she
rallied as we approached St. Michel.
</p>

<p>
'Dear Arthur,' said she, patting my bridle-hand, while a
beautiful smile lit up her loving blue eyes, 'you have a
princely heart!  I would that I were a countess&mdash;yea, even
mademoiselle of Lorraine for your sake.'
</p>

<p>
'The beautiful Marie-Louise?'
</p>

<p>
'Yes&mdash;even the beautiful Marie-Louise&mdash;she who is
deemed so proud, so artful, and intriguing.'
</p>

<p>
'Wherefore?'
</p>

<p>
'Because you could not say or sacrifice more for me, a
poor girl, than I would then do for you, a simple
gentleman.'
</p>

<p>
'Listen to me, Nicola.  Lovely as this princess, the bride
of Count Pappenheim, is famed to be, high though her race,
and splendid her fortune, I would not give one golden hair of
your beautiful head, Nicola, for Louise with all her rank and
splendour.'
</p>

<p>
'Dear, kind, and loving Arthur!' said she, smiling through
her tears; 'but I ought not to love you.'
</p>

<p>
'Nicola?'
</p>

<p>
'It is very true&mdash;but too true.'
</p>

<p>
'And why?'
</p>

<p>
'For many reasons more than I dare to say.  One I may
mention&mdash;&mdash;'
</p>

<p>
'Name it.  But already you have named so many.'
</p>

<p>
'You are a Huguenot&mdash;I a Catholic.'
</p>

<p>
'Well, and what of that?'
</p>

<p>
''Tis an error in faith my doing so; but I fear that we
poor women are all pagans in the question of duty when it jars
with love.'
</p>

<p>
'Then kiss me, my beautiful heathen.'
</p>

<p>
We were now close to the gate of St. Michel, and,
alas! consequently only thirty miles from Nanci, and we felt more
<i>triste</i> than ever.
</p>

<p><br /><br /><br /></p>

<p><a id="chap40"></a></p>

<h3>
CHAPTER XL.
<br /><br />
THE DAUGHTER OF MACBETH.
</h3>

<p>
The old town of St. Michel, the capital of a bailiewick of the
same name, now rose before us on an eminence.  The banner
with the three fleur-de-lis waved above its ramparts, showing
that French troops occupied it, and they proved to be a
squadron of Roger de St. Lacy's dragoons.  Louis XIII. had
first taken this little barrier town, the seat of the Parliament
of Lorraine during the war of 1632, but restored it again by
the treaty of Livourdin.  It was now chiefly noted for a
splendid Benedictine monastery, where the reliques of St. Lucy
the Scot were brought for preservation from the church of
Mount St. Lucy, which stood near the Rhine, some miles
distant.
</p>

<p>
The silvery mist was rising from wood and hollow as we
approached the town.  The green leaves glistened in the sun,
and the long, graceful willows waved in wind, which rustled
the chestnut foliage.
</p>

<p>
We breakfasted at a hamlet situated in a dell near the
Meuse; and after showing our credentials at the gate as an
abbé and daughter of Father Vincent de Paule, we rode
straight to the Benedictine abbey, at the outer porch of which
we dismounted; and then, leaving me with the horses,
Nicola, with a sweet smile, a graceful nod of her pretty head,
and a promise not 'to tarry long,' entered the magnificent old
Gothic church of St. Bennet.  Having buckled the bridles of
our horses to iron rings in the walls, I sat for some time on
the stone bench of the portal, lost in reverie, before I became
aware that an old priest, in the usual dress of a French
ecclesiastic, with a little black silk calotte cap drawn over his
white hairs, had seated himself at my side, and was regarding
me with attention.
</p>

<p>
I bade him good morning, for the day was yet young.
</p>

<p>
'Bon jour, M. l'Abbé,' said he, 'but by your bearing I do
not take you to be an ecclesiastic.'
</p>

<p>
'Indeed!'
</p>

<p>
'Monsieur will excuse me, but such is the case.'
</p>

<p>
'How?'
</p>

<p>
'Abbés do not sit with one leg over the other, or play with
their moustaches, neither do they usually wear a sword, for
such are not conventual customs.'
</p>

<p>
'But I am travelling, and find a warlike aspect advantageous
at hotels and barrier-gates; and then we all know
that Monseigneur the present Archbishop of Paris was the
best swordsman in France.'
</p>

<p>
'Except the Chevalier Hepburn.'
</p>

<p>
'Yes.'
</p>

<p>
'Ah! of course; except our countryman, the Chevalier
Hepburn.'
</p>

<p>
'How! our countryman?' I asked.
</p>

<p>
'I detected the Scot as well as the soldier, sir,' said the
old man, smiling and pressing my hands.  'I presume you
belong to the French army?'
</p>

<p>
'Perhaps I do; but you are very inquisitive.'
</p>

<p>
'Do not be alarmed; though I live in the territories of
Duke Charles, I am Father Allan Colville, a priest of the
Scottish college founded by Gregory XIII. at Pontamoussin,
some miles from this, in the bailiewick of St. Michel, and
have no interest in the quarrels of kings and dukes, though
the young Prince of Vaudemont, who has a fancy for me,
made me custodier of the reliques of St. Lucy, before which
your companion is now at prayer.  The sister of Vincent de
Paule is your wife, I presume, in disguise?'
</p>

<p>
'No,' said I, colouring to the temples.
</p>

<p>
'Your sister, perhaps?'
</p>

<p>
'No,' I repeated, with increasing vexation; 'the exigencies
of war force us to travel together, though we are neither kith
nor kin.'
</p>

<p>
'Pardon me,' said the padre, adding (to change the
conversation), 'perhaps you know that St. Lucy was a
country-woman of our own?'
</p>

<p>
'Like St. Fiacre, I suppose; but you must excuse my
ignorance, for I never heard of the good lady until to-day,' I
replied, with a smile.
</p>

<p>
'She was the daughter of a king.'
</p>

<p>
'I am rather sceptical on these points, father,' said I,
smiling again, 'for in France all the ancient saints are sons or
daughters of kings, counts, and emperors.  Sanctity in those
days was increased by rank.'
</p>

<p>
'You will find in Camerarius and in the French Breviary
that she was the daughter of a Scottish king, of Macbeth the
Usurper; who, to atone for the crimes of her father, after
escaping from the castle of Dunsinnane, retired in 1160 to
serve God in obscurity.  Wandering from our native land
she reached the banks of yonder river, the Meuse, and
choosing a solitary place, a wooded mountain in the diocese of
Verdun, there built unto herself a cell, where she died, in
1190, in all the odour of sanctity, and was enrolled among the
saints by the Bishop of Verdun, Henry of Blois, otherwise
called of Winchester, brother of Stephen king of England.
Great pilgrimages have been made to her reliques, which in
the summer season are kept in the church of Mont St. Lucy,
erected in her honour in 1625 by a prince of the house of
Guise, who espoused a sister of the present Duke Charles IV.'
</p>

<p>
'This is a curious story,' said I; 'but I suppose these
reliques are only a few bones.'
</p>

<p>
'Heaven pity thee!' exclaimed the old priest; 'bones,
quotha!  I would that you were one of the ancient faith to see
the saint as we see her&mdash;to see her as if she died but yesterday.'
</p>

<p>
'Indeed!'
</p>

<p>
'Her body is completely enclosed in a transparent coffin of
the purest Venetian crystal, and therein she lies, robed in
white, looking lovely in her virgin purity, for in death her
features resumed all the bloom of youth.  Her tresses are of
the brightest gold; her features are soft and placid; the long
lashes of her eyes are closed, imparting a charming expression
of modesty and repose to her sleeping face, and a virgin crown
encircles her brows.  Her hands, small and delicate, are
crossed upon her breast; one retains a golden chalice, the other
her crucifix; and when prayers of more than ordinary purity
are raised to heaven at her shrine, her lips have been seen to
smile, and a shining brightness to spread over her face and
robes&mdash;a light that filled the beholders with extasy and awe.
Moreover, through the pores of that crystal coffin there cometh
at times a fragrance&mdash;a delightful perfume, like that emitted
of old by the body of Polycarp, the early martyr.'
</p>

<p>
'And she was a daughter of Macbeth!  By my soul,
I would give a louis to see all this.'
</p>

<p>
The priest shook his head.
</p>

<p>
'And her body is quite undecayed, you say.'
</p>

<p>
'Less so than yours or mine,' retorted the priest.
</p>

<p>
'And yet she died&mdash;'
</p>

<p>
'More than five hundred years ago.'
</p>

<p>
'Excuse me, Father Colville, but really&mdash;'
</p>

<p>
'You think this strange; but does not Volterranus tell us
of the body of a young girl&mdash;fair, delicate, and beautiful&mdash;being
found in a Roman sepulchre during the pontificate of
Alexander VI.?'
</p>

<p>
'Very likely; but I do not believe in Volterranus.'
</p>

<p>
'He says, that she was enclosed in a marble chest: her
loveliness dazzled all; her hair, which was long and flaxen,
was gathered upon her head by a tiara of shining gold.  At
her feet stood a burning lamp, the light of which was
extinguished by the atmosphere on the vault being opened.  And,
by an inscription on her tomb, this fair young girl proved to be
"Tulliola, the best-beloved daughter of Cicero;" but because
she was an unbaptized pagan, Pope Alexander ordered her
body, so wonderfully preserved, to be cast into the Tiber,
which was done accordingly.  But to return: our shrine of
St. Lucy was visited, in 1609, by the Duchess of
Lorraine&mdash;a lady of the house of Mantua.'
</p>

<p>
'The mother of the present Prince of Vaudemont.'
</p>

<p>
'No; the mother of his half-sister, the famous Mademoiselle
Marie Louise, who is now in Paris.  It was also visited
with great solemnity by his present majesty Louis XIII.,
when he was besieging St. Michel four years ago; and on that
occasion his favourite, Madame d'Amboise, laid all her rings
and bracelets on the shrine.  It is to be visited by
Mademoiselle of Lorraine, after her marriage with Count
Pappenheim&mdash;an event to which I look forward with a somewhat
selfish interest.'
</p>

<p>
'Why?'
</p>

<p>
'Because the wedding-dress of the bride is to be my gift,
as keeper of the reliques.'
</p>

<p>
From this musty garrulity and monastic gossip, of which&mdash;with
a mind so preoccupied&mdash;I felt heartily weary, I was relieved
on Father Colville being summoned by an old Benedictine;
and just as he retired, my attention was attracted by
a handsome and well-appointed cavalier, who, with two valets,
like himself well mounted and armed, rode hastily up to a
large tree which stood before <i>La Pomms d'Eve</i>, an auberge
opposite the abbey.  Imperiously summoning the landlord, he
called for wine, but without dismounting.
</p>

<p>
Something in the air of this young spark, and in the cock of
his feather, seemed familiar to me; and, on approaching,
I recognised the young Marquis de Toneins, camp-master of
the Regiment de Normandie, and son and heir of the Marechal
Duc de la Force.

</p>

<p class="noindent">
I hummed the song of the subtle Iago in the Moor of Venice,
and, like him, adding&mdash;
</p>

<p>
'Some wine, ho!' stepped towards the tree under which
the Marquis and his two followers were regaling.  The latter
stared at me with the usual insolence of liveried valets, until
their master raised his hat, exclaiming&mdash;
</p>

<p>
'Pardieu! who do I see?  M. Blane of the King's
Guards&mdash;M. Blane here, and dressed as an abbé!'
</p>

<p>
'Yes, Marquis&mdash;but so dressed, for a time only.'
</p>

<p>
'A strange garb for the king's most faithful soldier&mdash;and
his rival too, at times, if all tales be true.'
</p>

<p>
'Marquis, permit me to observe that your remarks are very
unwise.'
</p>

<p>
'Letters from Paris could tell us nothing about you&mdash;you
were keeping your whereabouts so very quiet, that it was
rumoured in the Garde du Corps Ecossais, you were about to
become ridiculous.'
</p>

<p>
'Marquis!'
</p>

<p>
'By marrying and becoming quite a respectable person.'
</p>

<p>
'A false rumour, on my honour!' said I, reddening as I
remembered the conversation in the forest last night; 'but
what have you to tell me of the Garde du Corps, Marquis?
Who are dead and who alive now?'
</p>

<p>
'Faith I can scarcely tell you; but I do not think the
cuirassiers muster above seventy-five now.  They have been
carrying themselves with glory, these lords of the creation,
and playing the devil in Alsace and on the Rhine.  You
delivered my letters to Marion de l'Orme?'
</p>

<p>
'Yes.'
</p>

<p>
'And how was the little one looking?'
</p>

<p>
'Divine as usual.'
</p>

<p>
'Bon! did you see anything of Madame la Duchesse de
Charost?'
</p>

<p>
'The beautiful divorced&mdash;no.'
</p>

<p>
'Yet you were all winter in Paris!'
</p>

<p>
'I was studying, my dear friend.'
</p>

<p>
'Studying&mdash;you?'
</p>

<p>
'Studying practically the interior economy of your French
prisons.'
</p>

<p>
'Tête Dieu!  I don't understand you&mdash;but your life in
Paris seems to have been very circumscribed.'
</p>

<p>
'Because it was confined to an upper chamber of the
Bastille.'
</p>

<p>
'The Bastille&mdash;diable!'
</p>

<p>
'I expected that exclamation; the prince of darkness
being the potentate usually applied to by such wild gallants
as you.'
</p>

<p>
'But let me hear all about this; for even at this distance
from Paris, the Bastille has a very alarming sound.'
</p>

<p>
I told him my story, at least so much of it as I deemed
prudent to reveal; and contrived to lay all the blame of my
captivity to the score of De Brissac's jealousy.
</p>

<p>
'So when you reach Paris, M. le Marquis,' said I, in conclusion,
'do me the favour to rip up a little of M. de Brissac's
skin.  I owe him a peculiar grudge for the part he played in
my affair, and especially for his manner of playing it.  Do
this for me; I shall follow suit if he escapes you, and if I live
to see the old towers of Notre Dame again.  I had no time
to give him an airing on the Boulevards, or at Montmartre,
before leaving Paris, being ordered off on such short
notice&mdash;moreover, he never leaves the side of Marion de l'Orme.'
</p>

<p>
'Mort de ma vie! then I am wholly at your service,' said
the Marquis, whose eyes sparkled with anger at this
information.
</p>

<p>
'Believe me, I shall be ready to do so much for you
again.'
</p>

<p>
'I always deemed De Brissac to be an unsophisticated
country Benedick, who luxuriated at his petit château near
Versailles, and was actually in love with his own wife.  So,
so&mdash;he has been at the Rue de St. Jacques.  Peste!  I shall give
him a wholesome horror of that locality after I reach Paris.'
</p>

<p>
On this matter these sparks really fought near the ferry of
the Nesle.  De Brissac afterwards became involved in the
plots formed by the King's dissolute and libertine favourite,
Henri de Cinq-Mars against Richelieu in 1642; but the
Cardinal played his cards with his usual skill and subtlety, for
Cinq-Mars perished on the scaffold at Lyons, and De Brissac
was broken on the wheel in the Place de la Grève at Paris.
But I am anticipating.
</p>

<p>
'This is the finest wine I have tasted since I crossed the
Rhine,' said the Marquis, setting down his cup and gathering
up his reins; 'ere long I shall be in my native province of
Champagne, and then I shall have such wine as hath never
been pressed in Germany since Father Noah planted the
grape and conferred on mankind the benefit of getting drunk.
And now farewell; I am bound to Paris, with despatches
from the Marechal-Duke, my father.  In a week I shall have
kissed Marion, thrown myself at the feet of Charost, run
De Brissac through the body, danced with the girls at the
Hotel d'Argent, and given a benefit to those at the Hotel
de Bourgogne.  I shall have coquetted with all the fleuristes
on Pont aux Colombes; got drunk at the Fleur-de-lis;
rattled the bones of Beelzebub in a dice-box with Ferte
Imbault, and Heaven knows all what more.  'Tis said this
war will soon be over, for Richelieu has discovered and sent
to the Bastille, Mademoiselle de Lorraine, whom he will
probably marry perforce to some French peer.  Thus
Louis XIII. will easily bring the Duke her father to terms, it
is thought.  But, apropos, before we part, let me warn you to
beware how you venture near Nanci.'
</p>

<p>
I had been glancing anxiously from time to time at the
porch of the Benedictine church, in expectation of seeing my
devotee appear; and I had soon tired of the harebrained
young Marquis, whose light conversation savoured so much of
Paris and the old style of the French camp.  It bored and
disgusted me after the pleasant days I had spent in the pure and
virtuous society of Nicola; but now his warning interested me.
</p>

<p>
'I am to avoid Nanci, you say&mdash;why, Marquis?'
</p>

<p>
'It is full of the enemy.'
</p>

<p>
'This is indeed unfortunate for me.'
</p>

<p>
'Rather, as it lies in your front.  While my valiant papa,
the Marechal-Duke, was occupying himself near Strasburg,
Charles IV., with his son, the Prince of Vaudemont, and that
young fire-eater, Wolfgang Count Pappenheim, with four
thousand chosen troops, crossed the Rhine by a bridge of
boats, and reaching the old capital of Lorraine by a forced
march, are now actually holding high festival in the ancient
palace of the duchy.'
</p>

<p>
'Parbleu!  I must be careful&mdash;being under orders, or
promise rather, to see a lady to the gates of Nanci.'
</p>

<p>
'A lady?'
</p>

<p>
'Yes.'
</p>

<p>
'From whence?'
</p>

<p>
'Paris.'
</p>

<p>
'Peste! is she pretty?'
</p>

<p>
'I cannot say&mdash;she is an ecclesiastic.'
</p>

<p>
'Nom d'un Pape! and do you think to make me believe
that you have travelled all the way from Paris with a pretty
woman, without seeing so much as her face?  Very likely,
M. le Garde Ecossais!'
</p>

<p>
At that moment, Nicola in her sombre garb appeared at
the huge Gothic porch of St. Bennet, where she looked around
her irresolutely.
</p>

<p>
'Oho, M. l'Abbé,' said the reckless Marquis, 'there is
your little penitent awaiting you.  Pleasant this! by my faith,
I shall doff the corslet, and don the cassock too&mdash;but a safe
journey to you&mdash;au revoir!'
</p>

<p>
'Adieu!'
</p>

<p>
I raised my hat, and, followed by his two attendants, the
Marquis galloped gaily down the road which led towards the
forest wherein Nicola and I had passed the night.
</p>

<p>
On joining her, she greeted me with what was almost a
caress; and whether it was the effect of her devotion I know
not, but now she seemed placid, content, and even cheerful&mdash;yet
my heart was still wrung.
</p>

<p>
'To-morrow we will be at Nanci; and on the morrow
after we will be parted, Nicola, parted to meet no more,'
said I, lifting her into her saddle.
</p>

<p>
'My dear, dear Arthur,' said she, bending her face close
to mine; 'your accent and expression tear my heart with
sorrow&mdash;you doubt me&mdash;oh! what shall I say, to convince,
and to reassure you?'
</p>

<p>
'Why should all this be, Nicola; listen to me.  Here are
a church and a priest,' (Father Colville was at that moment
waving to us an adieu from the porch,) 'why cannot we marry?
Here is a ring too&mdash;it was my mother's, Nicola.  'Tis but a
few words&mdash;"with this ring, I thee wed&mdash;this gold and silver
I give thee&mdash;and with all my worldly goods, I thee endow,"
and then heaven alone could separate us.'
</p>

<p>
'Poor Arthur! your gold and silver, as yet, the pay of a
Scottish cuirassier; your worldly goods in France, the dust
of a day's march.  Yet would I wed you,' she added, while
her tears fell fast and hot; 'but I have others than myself,
to consult, others who would rather see me in my grave than
the wife of soldier of fortune.  Our ranks are unequal; and
I&mdash;with all your present love&mdash;would wed but future misery.'
</p>

<p>
'Oh!  Nicola, and have you no trust in me?  What mean
you by present love, and future misery?'
</p>

<p>
'Would you rejoin the proud, fiery, and haughty Garde de
Corps Ecossais, with a French soubrette as your bride?'
</p>

<p>
'No&mdash;we would quit France.'
</p>

<p>
'Does not this admission show there is a shame to shun?'
</p>

<p>
'A shame, Nicola!' I stammered.
</p>

<p>
'Yes&mdash;and what of the Countess's promises to you&mdash;are
they as yet fulfilled?'
</p>

<p>
'Alas! no.'
</p>

<p>
'And your despatches for M. le Chevalier Hepburn; are
they as yet delivered?'
</p>

<p>
'True&mdash;true; but the dread of losing you renders me
desperate, and blind to everything.'
</p>

<p>
'Enough, dear Arthur&mdash;let us talk of this no more.'
</p>

<p>
'Yet, Nicola, for you I would risk any danger; for I love
you, as I have never loved any woman, since I buried my
poor mother, who sleeps far away from me, in the old
churchyard at Glenkens.'
</p>

<p>
As if she dreaded her own resolution, Nicola whipped up
her horse, and muffling her face, and, as I thought, her sobs,
in her hood, rode on.  I followed, and thus we sorrowfully
left the gates and ramparts of St. Michel behind us.  I
informed her of the risk we ran&mdash;I at least&mdash;as Nanci was
full of the troops of Duke Charles, and of Wolfgang
Pappenheim, his intended son-in-law.
</p>

<p>
She expressed joy to hear that the brave old Duke was in
possession of his hereditary home, which, as she was a
Lorrainer, was only natural and proper; but she shuddered
at the name of young Pappenheim, who, to all his father's
brilliant courage, united the cunning of the fox with the
pitiless ferocity of the tiger.

<h3>
CHAPTER XLII.
<br /><br />
VAUDEMONT.
</h3>

<p>
As we proceeded, we hourly heard of the terrors and ravages
committed by the Count de Bitche, colonel of the petardiers
of Lorraine, a man steeped to the lips in crime and sin; and
by Wolfgang and his imperial corps, a Croatian regiment,
upon those Lorrainers who had made terms with Cardinal de
Lavalette, with Hepburn, or La Force; and more especially
upon those who had supplied the troops of those leaders with
forage, food, or money.  Some were broken alive on the
wheel, others shot or hung, according to the whim of their
captors; and rumour affirmed that the young Prince of
Vaudemont went hand in hand with his future brother-in-law
in the committal of these atrocities, especially in Alsace, the
duke of which was a mere child of nine or ten years old.
From her recent residence in Paris, Nicola believed that she
had everything to fear from the terrible Croats, and grew
paler than a lily, when, near Commercy, a town on the left
bank of the Meuse, we passed a row of men hanging by the
neck upon trees by the wayside, with their visages black,
swollen, and frightful, exposed to our gaze, and to the ravages
of a flight of bloated ravens that were wheeling round them.
</p>

<p>
At Commercy, which is celebrated only for the manufacture
of those little cakes called Madeleines, we saw the noble
château of the Princes of Vaudemont, an open, black, and
roofless ruin, just as it had been left by Lieutenant Frank
Ruthven, of Ramsay's musketeers, who had crossed the Meuse
one dark night at the head of eighty Scots, stormed the gates,
and burned the seat of the heirs-apparent of Lorraine.*
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p class="footnote">
* It is now a French cavalry barrack.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
A night in the forest, exposed to the inclemency of such a
storm, had not improved the condition of our horses, worn as
they were by so long a journey; and Dagobert, whose old
military hardihood a winter passed in the snug stables of the
Château d'Amboise had considerably impaired, was especially
cut up: thus, after a slow and tedious ride of some miles, I
found it necessary that we should halt at a little wayside
auberge, about a league beyond Commercy.  The host,
though reluctant at first to admit any stranger, so great was
the terror inspired by Pappenheim's Croats, and the Duke's
Imperialists, was ready enough to afford us quarters on
perceiving our ecclesiastical garb, in his simplicity believing
that, in case of foragers or plunderers coming that way, we
might give a little protection to his household&mdash;a vain hope
indeed.
</p>

<p>
Nicola was so sad, weary, and reflective, that I did not
again renew the ever-present subject of my thoughts and of
the past day's conversation, but I kissed her tenderly at the
door of her apartment, and bade her adieu for the night,
adding that I would summon her betimes on the morrow,
which would be the last day of our journey together.
</p>

<p>
Alas!  I knew not that it was the last time I should ever
see her again&mdash;as my beloved Nicola at least.
</p>

<p>
Over a stoup of wine, I sat moodily in the recess of a
window of the little auberge, recharging my pistols to keep
them in service order; and then I watched the setting sun, as
he sank in all his summer splendour, and cast long golden
gleams across the wooded dell, through which flowed the
waters of the Meuse, when the report of shots close by gave
me an <i>alerte</i>, and inspired me with an irresistible and unwise
desire to discover the reason thereof.  I ordered out my
horse, thrust the pistols into my girdle, and mounting, rode
leisurely along the highway for half a-mile or so, until I saw
the cause of the alarm.  A few troopers were galloping over
an eminence, bearing each a couple of sheep across his saddle,
while a cloud of smoke, streaked with flame, arose from the
crumbling walls of a farmhouse, which in mere wantonness
they had set on fire.
</p>

<p>
'If 'tis thus Duke Charles celebrates his temporary return
to Lorraine,' thought I, 'his people had better bend their
necks to Richelieu and King Louis.'
</p>

<p>
Turning my horse's head, I rode leisurely back at the same
pace towards the auberge, till at a turn of the road, which
was bordered by high green hedges, I came abruptly upon
two cavaliers, mounted, and armed with sword and pistol.
As the path was narrow, we simultaneously saluted each other,
and drew up to reconnoitre; for the time, place, and politics,
made us alike wary and suspicious.
</p>

<p>
'Sabre de Bois!' exclaimed a familiar voice, using that
exclamation which in France is old as the Crusades, and
means a cross or sword of wood; 'I think I should know that
face and figure.  Oho, M. Blane! we have changed guises
since we met last year at Sezanne.  'Tis thou art now the
abbé and I the layman.  By St. Nicolas of Lorraine, but this
is very droll!'
</p>

<p>
The speaker was the Prince of Vaudemout, and I heard him
with mingled anger and irresolution.
</p>

<p>
'Shall I recal the advice, the threat you made me, on that
day at the hotel in Sezanne?'
</p>

<p>
'You may, M. le Prince; but what was it?'
</p>

<p>
'Simply this: Retire; leave our vicinity; this espionage is not
honourable, and you test me too far.  Those words were well
calculated to rankle in a heart so proud as mine.  Do you
remember them?'
</p>

<p>
'I do.'
</p>

<p>
'And then you threatened to denounce me and poor Raoul
d'Ische, whose soul, I hope, has long since gone to glory.
Why should I not denounce you, and deliver you to the
nearest provost-marshal?'
</p>

<p>
'For two sufficient reasons, Monseigneur le Prince.'
</p>

<p>
'Name them.'
</p>

<p>
'First, you are too accomplished and brave a soldier to do
an act of wanton cruelty; and I am, also, I hope, too
accomplished and skilful a swordsman to let any two men
in the army of the Empire deprive me of this weapon, which is
now my sole inheritance.'
</p>

<p>
'Milles demons! thou art a gallant fellow, and I love this
spirit well; but nevertheless I must have you; so we will
fight it out fairly on the sward here, and my aide-de-camp, the
Count de Bitche, will be our umpire.'
</p>

<p>
'With pleasure,' growled the Count, through his enormous
moustaches.
</p>

<p>
'Agreed,' said I, bowing to that ruffianly noble, whom I
had given such good cause to remember our meeting in the
cavalry charge at Bitche; and his sinister eyes, as they gave
me a fierce glance of recognition, flashed like a sword-blade
when it is suddenly drawn from the scabbard.  'My life has
been risked and jeoparded so often, that when night sets in, I
feel at times astonished to find myself still in the land of the
living.  But, prince, lest I should fall in this encounter, give
me your word of honour,' said I, sadly and impressively,
'that you will fulfil my last injunctions.'
</p>

<p>
'My dear fellow, I have not the least desire to kill you.
Mordieu! not I; but I must disarm and take you prisoner.'
</p>

<p>
'Not if I can prevent you; but should aught fatal to me
occur, will you, as a gentleman, promise to conduct safely
and honourably to the gates of Nanci a young girl of
Lorraine, whom I have brought with me from Paris, and who is
now&mdash;&mdash;'
</p>

<p>
'Where?'
</p>

<p>
'At a little auberge in yonder hollow near the Meuse.'
</p>

<p>
'Where three willow trees overshadow the water?'
</p>

<p>
'Yes.'
</p>

<p>
'On my honour as a gentleman I will do this, faithfully and
truly.'
</p>

<p>
'Prince, I thank and believe in you.'
</p>

<p>
The Count de Bitche, a fierce-looking fellow, with a dark
and sinister expression, uttered a most unpleasant laugh; upon
which I gave him a scornful glance of defiance, and bit my
glove.  We had now reached a smooth piece of sward, a little
way aside from the high road; a grove of chestnut trees grew
half round it; the evening light was clear; in the distance lay
Commercy, with its spires standing in dark outline against the
blood red disc of the setting sun.  We all dismounted, and gave
our bridles to the Count de Bitche, who linked them to his
own.  We then threw our hats, cloaks, and gloves, on the
ground; buttoned up our pourpoints to the throat, drew our
rapiers, and stood on guard, De Bitche keeping near the
Prince to prompt and give him hints: thus he was doubly
armed against me; but my heart was too full of hope and
pride to find space for fear.
</p>

<p>
I prayed for victory only that I might return to Nicola,
who knew so little of the danger I encountered, and whose
dear, modest face and loving eyes I might never see again.
</p>

<p>
Our swords met, clashed, and for a moment were engaged
to the very shell; then we withdrew, watching each other
warily, blade pressed heavily against blade.  The Prince, a
skilful swordsman, made a feint on one side, and then a lunge
on the other, by which he ripped up an inch or two of my
sword-arm.  Now, as my skin is a ware upon which I set some
value, I became filled with sudden fury, and pressed him with
such vigour, that he was driven back, fighting hard, almost to
the chestnut trees.
</p>

<p>
'At him with your rapier <i>a la stoccata</i>!' said De Bitche,
who had drawn his dagger, an unwarrantable proceeding, and
his voice grew husky as he spoke, 'Ill betide you, Prince! be
wary, or he will nail you to a chestnut tree.'
</p>

<p>
'Silence, Count!' I exclaimed, 'or, by Heaven, I will nail
you first!'
</p>

<p>
He slunk back to where the horses stood, and in an instant
after I heard a snort, almost a cry, from one of them, and
casting a glance that way, saw Dagobert plunging fearfully.
This unusual circumstance so fully arrested my attention, that
I narrowly escaped being run through the lungs; but
recovering my guard, before the Count could withdraw his
useless thrust, I grasped his rapier by the cross, wrested it
away, and for a moment menaced his throat with my point;
then I stepped back breathless with excitement and fatigue.
</p>

<p>
The pale face of Vaudemont flushed crimson with shame
and vexation.  He uttered a fierce oath.
</p>

<p>
'Conquered again, and by you too&mdash;this is too much!  I
shall never again be able to hold up my head.'
</p>

<p>
'Nay, monsieur,' said I, bowing low, and presenting to
him his sword-hilt; 'let us be friends from this time forward;
and be it understood, that on whatever field we meet again,
you and I, at least, engage no more.'
</p>

<p>
'So be it, M. Blane,' said he, grasping my hand with the
sudden cordiality of a generous heart; 'we part friends; and
in this half-hour's encounter, you have taught me some tricks
in fencing which I shall not soon forget.  Adieu&mdash;return to
your pretty one at the auberge, and conduct her, yourself, to
the gate of Nanci; but promise me, that you do not enter;
for if taken prisoner there, even I may fail to protect you, as
in Nanci, at least, the Duke my father reigns supreme.'
</p>

<p>
He saluted me; leaped on his horse, and, followed by his
amiable aide-de-camp, the Count de Bitche, who gave me a
peculiar and malevolent smile, galloped away.
</p>

<p><br /><br /><br /></p>

<p><a id="chap43"></a></p>

<h3>
CHAPTER XLIII.
<br /><br />
L'HOMME PROPOSE&mdash;DIEU DISPOSE.
</h3>

<p>
'Dagobert, you devil of a nag,' said I, stroking his fine
head; 'you nearly caused a kind master to lose his life, by
making such an uproar.'
</p>

<p>
Gathering the reins I prepared to mount, when suddenly
the animal snorted again, and swerving round in an unusual
manner, nearly fell upon his haunches.  Blood on the grass
now attracted my attention; and, to my astonishment, I found
that the poor animal was wounded in the off hind-leg, and by
a slash from a sharp instrument, was irretrievably hamstrung!
</p>

<p>
I remembered the malevolent expression that lighted the
eyes of the wicked Count de Bitche; and that I had seen him
near my horse with his dagger drawn; I remembered also, the
wild snort and plunge, given at that moment by the animal,
a movement which, by startling me, so nearly caused me to
lose my self-possession and life together; and my heart filled
with anger and compassion, at the cruelty of this barbarous
Imperialist; for the noble horse was destroyed by a mutilation,
beyond the skill of farriery to cure; and as I wiped,
with my handkerchief, the moisture caused by agony in the
fine eyes of my beautiful Spanish barb, I felt a tear start to
my own; for I knew that now poor Dagobert must die.  I
thought of my pistols to end his misery&mdash;
</p>

<p>
'No, no, Dagobert&mdash;another must do this sad office for you.
My old nag, you and I have been too often under fire
together&mdash;we have too often shared the same meal, the same biscuit,
and the same bed of straw, for you to die by my hand.  Another
shall do this, and place the greenest sods above you
too.'
</p>

<p>
And thinking thus, I led him slowly, halting and with
difficulty, along the road, which he marked with blood, towards
the little inn that lay in the valley of the Meuse, intending to
have him shot and buried there by the aubergiste, to whom I
would give my saddle and holsters for his trouble.
</p>

<p>
Thus I lost a charger, the gift of Clara d'Amboise, and
worth at least six hundred crowns of the sun.
</p>

<p>
On the morrow I meant to conduct Nicola to Nanci; and
there, in my own name and character, to enclose to the Duke
of Lorraine, a solemn challenge to the cruel and infamous
Count de Bitche.  Full of these fiery thoughts, and pausing
at every two or three paces, for my poor horse moaned in its
agony, I proceeded slowly along the narrow path between the
hedgerows, and under chestnut-trees in full foliage, towards
the auberge; and as I went, the darkness grew deeper, for
the sun had long since set.  The stars studded the sky; and
between its wooded banks, the Meuse gleamed like a silver
current, as the round white summer moon rose above the
hills.
</p>

<p>
At the door of the wayside inn (a grotesque-looking house
of carved wood, with its upper windows opening from a steep
roof, which was buried under a load of woodbine, honeysuckle,
hops, and ivy) I was met by the old aubergiste, with
fear and wonder expressed in every feature of his otherwise
rather stolid visage.
</p>

<p>
'Oh Monsieur l'Abbé!  Monsieur l'Abbé!' he exclaimed;
'and so you are not killed after all!'
</p>

<p>
'Killed&mdash;no.'
</p>

<p>
'Nor even wounded?'
</p>

<p>
'No; but why do you ask?'
</p>

<p>
'Because&mdash;but where is mademoiselle, your sister&mdash;that
dear, pious daughter of Vincent de Paule?'
</p>

<p>
'Asleep, in her chamber, I presume; but what mean you
by all these questions?' I demanded, while a vague emotion
of alarm agitated me.
</p>

<p>
'Mademoiselle, about half-an-hour ago, was told that you
had been attacked on the road, and left dangerously wounded;
that you were dying, in fact, and had sent for her; so she
instantly went with them, in search of you.'
</p>

<p>
'With <i>them</i>!&mdash;with whom, fellow?&mdash;and who told her all
this?'
</p>

<p>
'M. le Comte de Bitche, who came hither hurriedly and
clamorously inquiring for the young girl of Nanci, whom an
abbé had brought from Paris.  He gave her these dreadful
tidings, and sadly terrified and grieved the poor little thing
became; but she threw on her hood, and hastened to you.'
</p>

<p>
'Accompanied by whom?&mdash;speak fellow, speak!'
</p>

<p>
'M. le Comte, and two other gentlemen of Monseigneur
de Vaudemont's suite.'
</p>

<p>
'Eternal infamy! it has all been a decoy&mdash;a snare!  Oh,
Nicola, Nicola! what insanity prompted me to leave you, even
for a moment?  Was the Prince with them?'
</p>

<p>
'No monsieur, no,' replied the aubergiste, trembling.
</p>

<p>
'Which way did they take her?&mdash;towards Commercy?'
</p>

<p>
'No; towards Nanci.'
</p>

<p>
I was about to spring on poor Dagobert, but remembered
his mutilation, and perceived at once the whole details of the
trick which had been played me by the Count de Bitche, on
hearing my request concerning the safety of Nicola&mdash;a
request made so solemnly to Vaudemont before we fought.
And so she had been carried away by this brutal and
unscrupulous noble, whose forcible abduction of the beautiful
Countess of Lutzelstein was so notorious throughout all
Germany and France; a crime which was followed by another
more terrible; for the corpse of that unfortunate lady, who
had been savagely strangled, was left ignominiously stripped
in the woods near his castle in Lorraine; and in her hands
was found a portion of a velvet pourpoint, which she had
clutched in her dying struggles, and which, by its remarkable
lacing, was known to have been worn by the Count.
</p>

<p>
And Nicola was in his power!
</p>

<p>
'The Count is a sorcerer, Monsieur l'Abbé,' said the
aubergiste, imploringly; 'so beware what you do.  He is said to
attend the sabbat in the forest of St. Michel; he anoints
himself with the fat of unbaptized children; he dries up the
milk of poor men's cattle, and turns the gold of the rich into
birchen chips; and he has an ointment which he puts on his
eyes, to enable him to see where treasure is hidden.  It was
thus he found the gold which Charles VII. buried in his old
Rendezvous de Chasse, in the forest of Loches, where it was
guarded by a dragon.  Beware, M. l'Abbé, beware! or at
least do not name me; for I am a poor man, whom he would
think no more of hanging than he would of drinking a cup of
wine.'
</p>

<p>
Heedless of all these warnings, on foot I rushed along the
road, with my sword drawn; but night had now closed in, and
objects had become vague and indistinct.  I placed an ear on
the ground to listen, but heard only the throbbing of my
heart; my whole brain seemed to have become one huge
pulse.  Nicola, whom I might never see again, seemed before
me, with all her thousand winning ways, her beauty and her
gentleness, her modesty and timidity&mdash;Nicola subjected to the
rude advances of this brutal and licentious lord!
</p>

<p>
My heart grew sick!
</p>

<p>
It was too much to think of&mdash;too exasperating a subject for
contemplation; and half-blind with rage and grief.  I rushed
along the Nanci road, which stretched far away before me,
lonely and silent in the light of the rising moon.
</p>

<p>
Thus Nicola was lost or taken from me; and all the injunctions
from the Countess, and my responsive promises, came
back to my memory with a glow of shame and mortification,
for, by my own neglect, I felt that I had forfeited my honour,
and would be disgraced in the estimation of them both for
ever.  But these reflections were altogether secondary to the
horror I experienced at the idea of her being subjected to
captivity by such a man as Rudolf de Bitche; and now, when
I had lost her, oh! how paltry did all my vile conventional
scruples about her humble birth and position seem to me!
Poor, beloved girl!
</p>

<p>
And now the song of Bernard de Ventadour, the sweet
minstrel who followed Elinor of Guienne, occurred to me:&mdash;
</p>

<p class="poem">
  'I thought my heart had known the whole<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of love; but small its knowledge proved;<br />
  For still the more my longing soul<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Loves on, itself the while unloved.<br />
  She stole my heart, myself she stole,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And all I prized from me removed;<br />
  She left me but the fierce control<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of vain desires for her I loved!'<br />
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
How lonely, voiceless, and silent seemed that moonlit
landscape to me then!
</p>

<p>
Nicola was indeed gone!
</p>

CHAPTER XLIV.
<br /><br />
TAKEN PRISONER.
</h3>

<p>
In my cloak-bag at the auberge I had left the king's
dispatches, addressed to Sir John Hepburn and to the Duc de
Lavalette, together with the case containing the baton of a
marechal of France, destined for the former; but I forgot
everything, save the desperate hope of rescuing Nicola and
of tracking her betrayers.
</p>

<p>
I made a hundred vows of vengeance on De Bitche, whom
I was one moment resolved to challenge to a solemn duel;
and at another, to pistol without ceremony when or wherever
I met him.
</p>

<p>
A group of dark figures on the roadway now appeared
about half-a-mile before me; and the gleam of steel informed
me that they were armed.  I hastened forward full of new
hope and a fierce joy.  Some of those persons were on foot,
and others on horseback; their number seemed to be about
twenty, and they marched in military order.  As I gained on
them, they halted; and then I perceived that two of the
horsemen returned to reconnoitre.  On drawing nearer, I
could reckon ten mounted troopers, and ten musketeers on
foot; but there was not a female with them.
</p>

<p>
'Stand, monsieur!' cried one, in French, but with a
guttural accent; 'was it you who hallooed?'
</p>

<p>
'Yes, my friend,' said I, breathlessly.
</p>

<p>
'For what purpose, fellow?'
</p>

<p>
I paused.
</p>

<p>
'Answer&mdash;I am General Goltz, of the Imperial army.'
</p>

<p>
'To stop you.'
</p>

<p>
'To stop us?' reiterated another, haughtily; 'here is an
enterprising Gascon for you, gentlemen!'
</p>

<p>
'A Scot, as you may find to your cost, sirs,' said I,
menacing them with my drawn sword.  'Is the Count de
Bitche among you?'
</p>

<p>
'No,' replied one, laughing; 'the Count has more pleasant
matters in hand than accompanying us.  But what seek you
here?'
</p>

<p>
'A companion I have lost&mdash;a young lady attired in a
religious habit&mdash;'
</p>

<p>
This was received by a hoarse shout of guttural German
merriment; for most of the personages among whom I had so
suddenly fallen were Imperialists belonging to the garrisons
of Toul or Nanci.
</p>

<p>
'There is a convent of pretty Bernardine nuns at Commercy,'
said General Goltz, turning his horse round; 'apply
there, my friend.
</p>

<p>
''Tis a chevalier in the guise of an abbé!' said one.
</p>

<p>
'The devil lurking behind the cross!' added another.
</p>

<p>
'A spy of Louis XIII.&mdash;a mouchard! a mouchard!' cried
the Lorraine musketeers, surrounding me.  'Hola, M. le
General&mdash;M. le Provost Marechal&mdash;a rope, a rope!  To the
next tree with him! a rope for the mouchard!'
</p>

<p>
This epithet for a spy or eavesdropper was peculiarly
offensive then in France, being derived from the spies of
M. de Mouchy, the Inquisitor-General under Francis II., and it
inspired me with new anger.
</p>

<p>
'Who commands here?' I demanded, proudly, thrusting
back the most forward with the hilt and edge of my sword.
</p>

<p>
'I command&mdash;I, Wolfgang Count Pappenheim,' replied a
lofty and stern-looking cavalier, who was sheathed in
burnished steel from neck to knees, and who wore a broad hat
with a tall feather, and had long moustaches pointed straight
out in a line with his ears.
</p>

<p>
'Hear me, Count,' said I, glad in this desperate extremity
to avail myself of a little subterfuge; 'you dare not kill one
who wears this dress.'
</p>

<p>
'Bah,' said he, roughly; 'I have an indulgence from the
Pope to kill whom I please; but surrender, or by the death
of the devil, my fellows will make black puddings of thee!'
</p>

<p>
'My reputation, Count, is so well established both at
Versailles and in the camp of Duke Charles IV., that I need not
suffer myself to be needlessly hacked to pieces, rather than be
taken; and so, monsieur, I am your prisoner.'
</p>

<p>
'Your name, abbé, if an abbé you are, indeed?'
</p>

<p>
'I am Arthur Blane, a gentleman of king Louis's Scottish
Guard, and no abbé.'
</p>

<p>
'A cuirassier.'
</p>

<p>
'Yes, monsieur.'
</p>

<p>
''Tis he, Count, of whom poor Raoul d'Ische and the
Prince de Vaudemont have spoken so often,' said General
Goltz; 'parbleu! he is a brave fellow!'
</p>

<p>
'But must, nevertheless, swing, M. le General; he is a
spy.'
</p>

<p>
'Count, it is false,' I exclaimed.
</p>

<p>
'Then what seek you here, so far from your head-quarters,
and in this garb too?'
</p>

<p>
'A lady, M. le Comte, a lady who&mdash;'
</p>

<p>
'How&mdash;have you not ladies enough in the French camp?'
</p>

<p>
'She whom I seek is a lady of Lorraine, whom I had
pledged my word of honour to conduct in safety from Paris
to the gate of Nanci&mdash;being now en route to join the army of
Hepburn and Lavalette.'
</p>

<p>
'And who is this demoiselle, and what are her name and
rank, that she required a chevalier of the King's Scottish
Guard to escort her from Paris through Champagne and
Lorraine?'
</p>

<p>
Policy and emotions of a somewhat mingled nature made
me pause: to mention the name and position of Nicola, as a
soubrette of the King's mistress, would only have courted
ridicule and mischief.
</p>

<p>
'Who is she, monsieur?' demanded the Count.  'I think
at such a time as this, when rumour affirms that Mademoiselle
de Lorraine has been taken at a sequestered château near
Paris, and is now languishing in the Bastille, some wonderful
interest must be attached to the woman you are in quest of?'
</p>

<p>
'M. le Comte, she is&mdash;'
</p>

<p>
'What&mdash;speak!'
</p>

<p>
'My sister.'
</p>

<p>
'A likely story! we never heard that any of our ladies at
Nanci had brothers in the Garde du Corps Ecossais; but we
shall inquire into all this, at least before we hang you; so
give up your sword.'
</p>

<p>
'To whom?' said I.
</p>

<p>
'To me&mdash;it shall suffer no dishonour in my hands.'
</p>

<p>
''Tis well, Count; for that sword is the last inheritance of
a race that never knew dishonour&mdash;until now.'
</p>

<p>
'Soldiers should never condescend to play the mouchard.'
</p>

<p>
'Silence, Count, and be generous if you can!' said I,
choking with passion.  'If such were said of me after death,
I would come back to resent it, though all hell should bar
the way.'
</p>

<p>
Awed by my words, the superstitious German changed
colour and turned from me.
</p>

<p>
'A file of musketeers,' said General Goltz; 'Sergeant
Caspar Alsfeldt, guard the prisoner to Nanci, and shoot him
if he attempts to escape.'
</p>

<p>
'I will inquire into all this to-morrow at the Duke's palace,
where you will bring him before me,' said Pappenheim;
'farewell, M. le Prisonnier&mdash;may we part better friends
to-morrow than we do to-night.  Forward, gentlemen, for the
hours grow apace.'
</p>

<p>
Pappenheim, with General Goltz and all the mounted men
of his party trotted rapidly off; while I, bareheaded, disarmed,
downcast and heartbroken, was marched on foot, guarded by
ten musketeers of the regiment de Vaudemont, towards the
capital of Lorraine.
</p>

<p>
To attempt escaping would only have insured to me a
sudden and barbarous death; and when marched off I struck
my hands wildly together, and could have wept, but for very
grief and shame, as I thought of my own helplessness and
inability to unravel the mystery that enveloped the future fate
of my unfortunate but beloved Nicola.
</p>

<p><a id="chap45"></a></p>

<h3>
CHAPTER XLV.
<br /><br />
NANCI.
</h3>

<p>
My captor, Wolfgang Count Pappenheim, the intended son-in-law
of Duke Charles, was the son and heir of the great
Pappenheim of the German wars, he who had received no
less than fourteen wounds at the battles of Leipzig and Prague,
and was surnamed <i>le Balafré</i>, as he bore on his person exactly
one hundred scars received in the field of honour.
</p>

<p>
Young Pappenheim had won himself a high reputation for
bravery in those wars, especially by his defence of the castle
of Wilsburg, a stronghold of the Margravine of Anspach,
when it was assailed by the King of Sweden, who was anxious
to secure it for the Protestants of the Franconian circle; but
when summoned, Wolfgang replied&mdash;
</p>

<p>
'I will never surrender to a king of Sweden, but shall
perish here, and the ruins of Wilsburg will be my monument.'
</p>

<p>
Gustavus believed him on his father's reputation, and
consequently abandoned the siege.  Thus I had 'the mortifying
honour,' as Sergeant Alsfeldt told me, 'of having surrendered
my sword to one of the finest soldiers in the army of the
German emperor.'
</p>

<p>
In a state of anxiety that amounted almost to agony, I
marched towards Nanci, along a road the darkness of which,
as it was buried among coppice, was in unison with the gloom
and loneliness that oppressed my heart.  The cold white
moon waned and went down beyond the level horizon.  The
country thereabout, though richly wooded, is flat and
uninteresting, until the plain is bounded by the Vosges.  The
scenery grew dark, and the orangeries, vineyards, and coppice
that bordered the way seemed black and sombre, as the stars,
like diamonds in a dark-blue dome, twinkled in the early
morning sky.
</p>

<p>
The yellow dawn began to gild its eastern quarter above
the distant chain of the Vosges; green hill tops brightened in
the rising tide of light, and the vanes of village spires and of
old châteaux embosomed among oaks that were perhaps coeval
with Lothario, king of Lorraine, glittered in the rosy beams.
Squirrels and rabbits fled before us across the road from hedge
to hedge; the larks began to sing joyously, as the brilliant
morning came to gladden the hearts of all, apparently, but me;
for I had but one thought&mdash;Nicola!
</p>

<p>
'Where was she, then?  Where, how, and with whom had
she passed the weary hours since our fatal separation?'
</p>

<p>
I dared not trust myself to think, as footsore, weary, damp
with midnight dew, and covered with the dust of the summer
roadway, I came in sight of the city of Nanci, which I now
regarded with horror as the probable scene of a long and
exasperating imprisonment, or (it might be) a cruel and
ignominious death; for I was in the hands of soldiers who were
without scruple, pity, or remorse&mdash;the fierce men of the long
and barbarous thirty years' war.
</p>

<p>
Alsfeldt, the sergeant who had charge of me, proved, however,
to be a kind and considerate fellow.  Perceiving that I
was without a covering for my head, he attempted to
appropriate for my use the hat of the first man we met; a
proceeding which I would by no means sanction.  He was fond
of extolling the bravery of his colonel, the Prince of
Vaudemont, under whom he had served at the defence of Wilsburg,
and in some of the more recent battles of the Empire.  At a
wayside beer-house I entertained him and the musketeers of my
escort with cans of beer each; an act of attention which won me
their entire good-will.  The sergeant drank to my health and
better fortune as he raised the huge wooden tankard to his lips
and held it there, with the cheek-plates of his morion and his
long, bushy moustaches dipping in the froth, till the contents
were drained to the bottom.  The soldiers all promised
faithfully to prosecute every inquiry in the city and garrison
concerning the lady I had lost at the auberge of the Three
Willows; but they frankly told me that I had but a slender
chance of seeing her again if she was actually lured away by
the abductor of Laura of Lutzelstein.
</p>

<p>
The bells were being merrily rung as we entered Nanci,
and we also heard heavy salvos of artillery thundered from the
ramparts.
</p>

<p>
'What does all this mean?' I asked, 'Has a victory been won?'
</p>

<p>
'No, monsieur,' replied the sergeant; 'but Duke Charles
and the Duke of Alsace pass in state through the streets
to-day to high mass; and if you would wish to see them proceed
from the palace to the church of St. Epurus, instead of
marching you direct to where Count Pappenheim ordered me,
I shall halt for a time in the great square to oblige you.'
</p>

<p>
'Thanks, sergeant,' said I; 'but as I neither wish to be
stared at nor mocked by the rabble, I would rather proceed to
prison at once.'
</p>

<p>
'Nay, monsieur, 'tis to the palace, and not to a prison I am
to conduct you.'
</p>

<p>
Nanci, long celebrated as one of the most pleasant towns in
Lorraine, stands in the midst of a beautiful plain on the left
bank of the Meurthe, a river which rolls from the western
flank of the Vosges, bearing rafts of timber and faggots on its
foaming current to the lower country.  Nanci is divided into
two quarters: the old town of the eleventh century, and the
new one of the fifteenth.  The former, which is surrounded by
walls, defended by towers, and enclosed by gates and ditches,
contains, or contained in 1636, the ducal palace, the great
square, which is planted with stately lime-trees, and the
ancient parish church of St. Epurus.  The streets through
which I was conducted to this great square were old and
quaint, crooked and narrow.
</p>

<p>
By a magnificent gate resembling a triumphal arch, but
defended by cannon, and moreover decorated by green bays,
garlands, and banners, we entered the city.  Within were
guards of citizens clad in fine velvet doublets, armed with
sword, arquebuse, and partizan, wearing the Duke's colours in
their scarfs and on their hats; while bodies of Lorraine troops
and vassals, mingled with imperial pikemen, lancers,
musketeers, and artillery, under the princes of Vaudemont and
Lillebonne, filled all the thoroughfares.  The Marquis de
Marsal, the Counts of Rosiers and Luneville, with other
military nobles of the two duchies, all clad in brilliant armour,
with plumes in their helmets, gilded truncheons in their hands,
and orders of chivalry sparkling on their breasts, rode through
the streets, maintaining order among the vast concourse of
citizens and peasantry who thronged them, to welcome and
behold their gallant native prince&mdash;the hero of Prague&mdash;proceed
from his ducal palace to the city church.
</p>

<p>
In the principal square and near the palace gate my escort
halted and stood close around me.  The sergeant placed his
arm through mine for the double purpose of protecting me
and precluding an escape; and there we stood unobserved
among the masses of people who loaded the air of the clear,
bright summer morning with clamorous shouts, while cheers,
the tolling of bells, with the perpetual thunder of cannon and
bombardes rang on every side.
</p>

<p>
Exactly at the hour of ten a commotion was visible at the
palace; a thrill pervaded the dense multitude; all men
present who were not soldiers uncovered their heads, and all
grew silent for a moment; then there burst forth a hurrah of
welcome as the procession issued from the bannered portal of
the palace.
</p>

<p>
Duke Charles had been long absent from his native city,
serving under his patron and protector the Emperor; and now,
to celebrate his sudden return, all the loyalty of his people
had flashed up, as if to gild with a farewell splendour the
expiring glory of his house, and power&mdash;for the ancient Duchy
of Lorraine was doomed ere long to be merged and lost in the
growing kingdom of the line of St. Louis.  Yet his forefathers
had been men of power and valour, who had transmitted to
him a noble inheritance, with numerous titles, for he was
Duke of Lorraine and Merc[oe]ure; of Calabria, Bar, and
Guelderland; Marquis of Pontamoussin, and Nomenay; of
Provence, Vaudemont, Zutphen, Blamond, Saar-warden and
Salm; Hereditary Provost of Kummelsberg and Governor of
Anjou.

<p><a id="chap46"></a></p>

<h3>
CHAPTER XLVI.
<br /><br />
SURPRISE AND GRIEF.
</h3>

<p>
First came the principal citizens of Nanci, four abreast,
bearing steel partizans and clad in scarlet velvet pourpoints
and black serge breeches, slashed with red, guarding the
council of state, with the Master of Requests, their secretary,
eight advocates and two ushers, all wearing thick ruffs and
black gowns furred with white miniver.
</p>

<p>
Then followed the Great Master of the Household with his
twenty-eight officials, including the marshal of the kitchen.
</p>

<p>
The Great Chamberlain, with the physician, apothecary, &amp;c. in
black robes, attended by twenty-four valets de chambre
in the livery of the Duke.
</p>

<p>
The Masters of the Horse, the Hounds, the Waggons and
the Wardrobe, each with his staff of officials, all of whom
were named to me by old Sergeant Alsfeldt.  Then came a
company of petardiers under the Count de Bitche, whom I
longed to grasp by the throat.
</p>

<p>
The Grand Almoner in full canonicals with the banner of
St. Nicolas of Lorraine borne before him; having a covered
chalice in his hands, and his eyes cast downward on the earth.
</p>

<p>
The Grand Marshal, with the Marshals of Lorraine and
Bar, all clad in cloth of gold, magnificently mounted, with
their batons, banners, and helmets borne before them by
esquires or pages.
</p>

<p>
The priests of the Scottish college at Pontamoussin in their
sombre vestments, with the banners of St. Andrew and
St. Lucy borne before them.  The latter in the hands of old
Father Colville.
</p>

<p>
Then followed the commanders of the ducal troops; of the
two companies of gendarmerie; of the garde du corps of
Charles IV.; of the regiment of guards, and the Grand
Master of the Artillery of Lorraine, all accoutred in brilliant
half-armour and jack-boots, mounted on fine horses richly
caparisoned.  All these cavaliers were elderly men, as their
moustaches seemed grey or white; and their cuirasses glittered
with the orders of the Empire.
</p>

<p>
Attended by the Prince of Vaudemont and Count Pappenheim,
and surrounded by his richly-dressed garde du corps,
composed of one hundred chosen Switzers, with their trumpets
sounding and kettledrums beating, and followed by all the
officials of his civil tribunals, the Advocate General and
messieurs the Councillors of the Chamber of Accounts for
Nanci and Bar-le-Duc, came Charles IV., Duke of Lorraine,
a fine-looking old soldier, compact and stately in form, with
his head worn bare less by time than by the peak of his
helmet; he had keen dark eyes and large grizzled moustaches.
He was dressed in a suit of black velvet trimmed with narrow
lace and silver cord.  He wore a high stiff ruff, a
diamond-hilted sword, and the order of the Golden Fleece.  He bowed
kindly to the people, who greeted him with a storm of
acclamation, as he rode slowly past on a powerful black
charger, which he had ridden scatheless through many a
battlefield.
</p>

<p>
The Duke of Alsace, a son of the house of Suabia, who
feudally held his duchy of the house of Lorraine, rode on his
left hand, with his coronet borne before him, by an armed
Knight of Malta.  This Duke was a child about nine years of
age, and though I knew it not then, was destined to bear an
important position in this my narrative; but of that more in time.
</p>

<p>
A young lady clad in a suit of that rich white satin for
the manufacture of which Nanci is so famed, brocaded with
gold, rode at his right hand, and managed her horse's reins of
red silken fringe, with singular grace.  Her hair was of a
colour resembling gold, and escaped in brilliant locks from
under her broad hat, which had two long and drooping white
feathers.  Her face was turned from me, as she was conversing
with young Pappenheim; but the enthusiasm of the people
grew to a frenzy, in their shouts of welcome: for this
golden-haired girl was the Duke's only daughter; and as they
approached, the dense masses in the square swayed to and fro,
with such an impetus, that twice I was nearly thrown down
and trod under foot.
</p>

<p>
'Vive Mademoiselle Marie-Louise!' was the cry.
</p>

<p>
'Vive le Duc d'Alsace!'
</p>

<p>
'Vive Louise de Lorraine et M. le Comte de Pappenheim!'
</p>

<p>
Such were the shouts that burst like a storm around me.
</p>

<p>
'Is that young lady the daughter of the Duke?' I asked
of the sergeant, who still held me fast by the arm.
</p>

<p>
'Yes, monsieur.  Pardieu! but she is lovely!  Her horse
is stopped by the crowd&mdash;a moment, and she will look this
way.'
</p>

<p>
'I thought she was in the Bastille, at Paris.'
</p>

<p>
'So we all thought; but, last night, she returned to Nanci.
That is the gallant Count Pappenheim (son of Godfrey <i>le
Balafré</i>), whom she is to many, that now she is chatting to
so gaily.  Now, she turns our way&mdash;look!  Monsieur, look!
O vive Mademoiselle de Lorraine!'
</p>

<p>
The fair young lady heard the stentorian shout of Alsfeldt;
she turned to us, and bowed.
</p>

<p>
'My God! <i>'tis Nicola!</i>' I ejaculated in a breathless voice&mdash;a
voice, at least, unheard amid the clamour round us; and
so overwhelming were my emotions, on making this discovery,
that, had not that good fellow, the sergeant, supported
me, I must have fallen at his feet.
</p>

<p>
Bareheaded, travel-stained, crest-fallen in bearing, and
crushed in spirit, I stood a guarded prisoner in the open
streets of Nanci, while this brilliant pageant passed before
me; and a tide of strange emotions, but chiefly astonishment
and grief, with many bitter, bitter thoughts, swept in one
wild current through my heart.  There was a buzz in my
ears; but I heard nothing now, neither the clanging of the
church bells, the salvoes from tower and rampart, nor the
acclamations of the people; I saw only Nicola; and this fantastic
procession in quaint costumes, glittering garbs and armour,
that like some fairy pageant or the phantasmagoria of delirium,
were bearing her away from me&mdash;she whom I loved so well!
Yet it was no dream, no delusion, and no mockery of the
brain, for I knew that beloved face too well to be mistaken
for a moment now.
</p>

<p>
'Nicola!  Nicola!'
</p>

<p>
I strove to speak, but my voice could only whisper; I
strove to stretch my arms towards her, but they sank
powerless by my side.
</p>

<p>
As the Switzers of the ducal garde du corps roughly beat back
the people with the staves of their halberds, and opened a
passage again, the procession moved on.  As she passed, I thought
her eye caught a sight of my upturned face, amid that sea of
faces round her; and, if so, I am assured that the stupefaction
and agony it expressed, must have struck a pang in her
heart&mdash;for she trembled, grew ghastly pale, and nearly fell
from her white horse, but Pappenheim caught her hand; the
pageant moved on, and I saw her no more&mdash;for that day at least.
</p>

<p>
Pen cannot describe all that whirled through my heart and
brain on that dreadful day, in the streets of Nanci&mdash;a day, to
me, of sorrow and bewilderment.
</p>

<p>
A huge cup of wine, brought by the old sergeant, and
dashed with brandy, restored me to a certain extent; and in
one hour after this, I found myself, with my escort, in a
chamber of the ducal palace, awaiting the behest of Count
Pappenheim, who had not yet returned from the church of
St. Epurus.
</p>

<p>
'It is all a dream&mdash;a nightmare&mdash;from which I shall soon
awaken!' thought I.

<h3>
CHAPTER XLVII.
<br /><br />
THE PALACE.
</h3>

<p>
The Duke's garde du corps of horse, consisting of a hundred
Lorraine troopers, who wore white hocquetons over their
cuirasses, with a regiment of German imperial infantry, clad in
buff coats, with black helmets of hammered iron, occupied the
gates, approaches, and lower apartments of the palace in
which they had been quartered, so that the people of Nanci
might be as little as possible oppressed by their presence.
</p>

<p>
The princely residence of the Dukes of Lorraine stands in
the oldest portion of the city.  It has a magnificent entrance,
within which was a vestibule, lined by lacqueys, guards, and
pages.  From thence, we passed into a noble quadrangle,
encircled by a piazza, the columns and arches of which are
covered by florid carving, and embellished by many statues
and bassi-rilievi.  It has also several towers, one of which
served for an arsenal and magazine of arms; the others were
staircases.  It has gardens of great space and beauty, enclosed
on one side by the ramparts of the city.  Surrounded by my
escort and a crowd of staring lacqueys and pages, I remained
in the guard-chamber of the palace, oblivious and heedless
alike of their impertinence, and the peculiarity of my position,
occupied by one overwhelming thought, until I was roused by
a sub-brigadier of the gendarmerie, who rode in, with an order
from Monseigneur the Prince of Vaudemont, who had just
been accidentally informed of my capture, to conduct me to a
proper apartment, where every comfort and attention should
be given me; that my escort were to retire, and that I should
consider myself as a prisoner on parole of honour.
</p>

<p>
I thanked the sub-brigadier, and bade the sergeant, Alsfeldt,
adieu, giving him a crown of the sun to drink my health with
his comrades.  I was then led by a valet-de-chambre up one
of the staircases to a portion of the palace that overlooked the
gardens, and there three apartments, each of which might
have satisfied a marechal of France, were assigned to me.
The valet gave me every means of repairing or improving my
toilet, which a night spent in the custody of the musketeers,
and especially some cuts and slashes received in my late
encounter with Vaudemont, had somewhat deranged.
</p>

<p>
My sitting-room was lofty, and had three casemated windows
filled with painted glass; its walls were hung with dark-green
velvet, starred with gilded mullets.  An oak cabinet, bearing
a service of plate and shining crystal, stood at One end, and
above it hung a Madonna of Raphael.  On the white marble
mantelpiece was carved the celebrated device of the Guises,
an A within an O&mdash;<i>chacun</i> A <i>son tour</i>&mdash;meaning that every
angle had its turning.
</p>

<p>
I seated myself by the table at an open window, with my
head resting on my hand, seeking to arrange my thoughts,
and to recover from the astonishment, the sorrow, and
disappointment which oppressed me.
</p>

<p>
The soft breeze of noon fanned my brow and cheek, which
were flushed and hot.  It brought to me the perfume of
flowers and the fragrance of the orangeries.  The gardens
were beautiful with a thousand varied flowers; the sunshine
was bright and warm; the summer day in Lorraine was
ambient and glorious; but my heart was full of bitterness and
heavy grief&mdash;bitterness for my humiliating position, and grief
for the loss of Nicola&mdash;for I justly deemed that I had lost her
for ever.
</p>

<p>
The anguish of my disappointment was great; that this
artful little beauty should have fooled me, and trifled with a
love so honest and so true, so honourable and so pure as mine;
for I loved, and in the rash blindness of my boyish love would
have married her, when I believed her to be but a nameless
and penniless soubrette, and thus, for her sake, would have
trampled under foot all the inborn prejudice of race and name,
all that family pride and tradition which were ever the second
creed of a Scottish gentleman.
</p>

<p>
I could neither separate nor analyse all the fierce and bitter
thoughts that grew up within me, but an overwhelming
sense of deception and disappointment were uppermost; for
in the brocaded lady, sparkling with jewels, with necklaces
of diamonds and strings of pearls, mounted on a pawing steed
of spotless white, surrounded by dukes and princes, guards,
counts, and cavaliers&mdash;in Marie Louise of Lorraine, I could
no longer realise Nicola, the gentle, timid, and loving Nicola,
of my pleasant journey from Paris to the banks of the Meurthe&mdash;she
with whom I had passed so strange a night among the
rocks in the forest of Champagne.
</p>

<p>
While deceiving me as to her name and rank, she had
doubted my honour and trifled with my love: a bitter
conviction and a humiliating one.
</p>

<p>
Then other memories came, and I could scarcely doubt that
I had won an interest in her heart when I rehearsed over and
over again our conversations, all of which were graven in my
mind, especially that which took place in the forest near
St. Michel.  When I dwelt on her accents, and the expression
of her blue eyes and softly-feminine face, when she spoke
to me then, and on similar occasions, could I doubt that she
loved me?
</p>

<p>
Yes, I did doubt now, and in the anguish of that doubt I
could have wept.
</p>

<p>
I recalled the joy she had expressed on learning that Duke
Charles (but Duke Charles was her father) and Count
Pappenheim were at Nanci; I remembered, too, how merrily she
seemed to be conversing with the Count, as their brilliant
pageant passed through the public square.  These were
doubtless 'trifles light as air,' yet they were heavy as
cannon-shot to me.
</p>

<p>
'It is enough!' I exclaimed, with growing anger; 'I have
been befooled; this girl never loved me; and if she did, what
would her love avail me now?'
</p>

<p>
At that moment the rattle of kettle-drums, and sound of
trumpets and trampling of horses, announced the return of the
Duke, whose train rode into the echoing quadrangle.  I knew
that Nicola was there; but instead of looking from the
windows of the corridor, I placed my hands upon my ears,
and strove to shut out the sounds of triumph that tortured me.
</p>

<p><br /><br /><br /></p>

<p><a id="chap48"></a></p>

<h3>
CHAPTER XLVIII.
<br /><br />
CHARLES IV.
</h3>

<p>
M. Schreckhorn, an officer of the Swiss guard, was now
ushered into my chamber, and with much formality, and more
bad French, announced that the Duke required my presence in
the hall of the palace, so early as might be convenient for me.
This announcement was, of course, a command to be obeyed.
Duke Charles, the father of Nicola&mdash;I mean of Marie
Louise, for so I must in future name her&mdash;was about to
question me.  How my heart beat as I started from my
chair!
</p>

<p>
'I am ready,' said I.
</p>

<p>
'But your toilette, monsieur,' said the Swiss.
</p>

<p>
'True, I had forgotten it; excuse me for one moment,
M. le Suisse, and then I am at your service.'
</p>

<p>
I hastily removed all traces of my recent adventures and
discomforts, arranged my costume as well as its capabilities
permitted, and placed upon my left breast the cross of
St. Lazare, which I had hitherto carried in a secret pocket:
I was then conducted by the Swiss across the quadrangle and
up one of the guarded staircases, to the great hall of the
palace; the place where feasts were given, ambassadors
received, and high festival held.
</p>

<p>
This hall was a noble apartment of more than one hundred
feet in length.  I perceived that it was floridly decorated, and
that towards the upper end it was crowded by gentlemen in
glittering costumes and armed soldiers, for the halberds of the
hundred Swiss guards gleamed as their bearers stood ranked
along the wall, fifty on each side.  Tattered and dusty banners,
taken in ancient battles, hung darkly down from the arched
roof; and around the wall, on shields of carved stone, were
painted all the heraldic bearings of Duke Charles: the three
winglets of Lorraine, covered by a ducal mantle, and
surmounted by an eagle; burele <i>argent</i>, and <i>gules</i> for Hungary;
the fleur-de-lis <i>or</i>, on a barbel <i>gules</i> for Naples; the crosslets
of Jerusalem; the four pales <i>gules</i> of Arragon; the fleur-de-lis
with a border <i>gules</i> for Anjou; the golden lion of Guelderland,
and the black lion of Juliers, with two barbels of
Bar-le-Duc.
</p>

<p>
Under these honours hung the portraits of those dukes of
Lorraine who had won them by war or alliance, painted by
Jan de Mahuse, by Titian, Rubens, or Poussin.  There was
grim Godfrey of Ardennes in the chain armour in which he
was slain by the Saracens at the battle of Louvain; Gothelo
who stormed Verdun from Conrad the Salique; Baldwin,
King of Jerusalem and Duke of Lorraine; Duke Theobald II.,
who fought so valiantly at Spire; Duke Raoul, who was slain
at Cressy; Duke Claude, armed cap-a-pie, as he appeared at
the passage of the Alps in 1515; his daughter, (the mother of
Mary Stuart,) Marie of Lorraine, whose birth-place, the old
ducal castle of Bar, had&mdash;in memory of her&mdash;been spared from
sack and fire last winter by the Garde du Corps Ecossais;
Anthony Duke of Lorraine and Calabria, who fought the
Lutherans and conquered Alsace, a stern warrior sheathed in
black armour, and bearing on his left wrist a Scottish falcon,
the gift of our monarch James V.; in short, the hall was
surrounded by portraits, real or imaginary, of all the thirty-two
dukes of the old Merovingian house of Lorraine, and the
thirty-third in succession awaited me under a canopy or cloth
of estate, seated at a table, which was covered by papers and
letters, the usual paraphernalia of a council-board; and as I
gazed about me and thought of all the past glories of this
ancient line of ducal princes, even the hope that Marie Louise
would pity the passion with which she had so wantonly
inspired me died away in my aching heart.
</p>

<p>
The Duke was still attired as I had last seen him in the
morning.  Pappenheim stood by his chair, eyeing me with
dark scrutiny, for he had a keen, penetrating eye and imperious
expression of face.  De Bitche stood a little in the background
in his half armour, as colonel of the petardiers, and under his
open helmet I read an expression of undisguised malice in his
eye.  I had a debt to settle with this worthy personage; but
the trick he had played me, and the destruction of my fine
horse, were, at that moment, less near my heart than a sense
of bitterness at the discovery I had made, and of the humiliation
of standing before Charles of Lorraine in the character of a spy.
</p>

<p>
I looked anxiously round for Vaudemont, but he was not in
the hall, neither was his sister, though many ladies of rank
were present; and as I approached, with an air of as much
firmness and honest dignity as I could assume, the courtiers of
the military Duke, the councillors of state, master of requests,
keeper of the seals, and others drew near, while the officer of
Swiss presented, saying, in a low voice,&mdash;
</p>

<p>
'Monseigneur le Duc, this is the gentleman our
prisoner&mdash;M. l'Abbé.'
</p>

<p>
'I am no abbé, M. le Suisse,' said I, bluntly; 'I am
Arthur Blane, a Scottish gentleman in the service of king
Louis.'
</p>

<p>
'And none in his garde du corps is more gallant or more
true,' said the old Duke, drawing off his long leather glove,
and presenting his hand to me; not to kiss, after the absurd
fashion of princes, but to press, like a brave, honest man; for
this venerable soldier, though usually calm and grave, and
lofty without pride, could act act very impulsively at times.
</p>

<p>
'By this honour, Monseigneur,' said I, in a voice that grew
tremulous with conflicting emotions, 'I presume that I am not
to be treated as a prisoner of war.'
</p>

<p>
'Prisoner?&mdash;no, no my brave stranger&mdash;my daughter has
told me all.'
</p>

<p>
'All?' I reiterated in my heart; 'what can he mean by all'?'
</p>

<p>
'I have much to thank you for, M. Blane; but I am an
old soldier, and have few words to spare; yet I can well
appreciate deeds of honour, faith, and loyalty.  I would speak
with you of my daughter, Mademoiselle Marie-Louise, whom
you have hitherto known under the very homely name of
Nicola.'
</p>

<p>
'Of Nicola&mdash;oh yes, Nicola!' I faltered involuntarily, for
that dear name, rendered by association so delightful to my
ear, made me start, as it stirred my inner heart.  A large
mirror hung near me; I surveyed my own face in it, and the
immobility of its features surprised even myself.  This
expression was fortunate, as I was the centre of many curious eyes,
that stared at me without the slightest ceremony.
</p>

<p>
'You hear me?' said the Duke, gently.
</p>

<p>
'Monseigneur, I am all dutiful attention.'
</p>

<p>
'Mademoiselle Louise was discovered last night at a
country hostelry, between this and Commercy.'
</p>

<p>
'Discovered&mdash;&mdash;'
</p>

<p>
'By the Count de Bitche, colonel of our petardiers, who
had gone there on a mission of kindness, believing her to be a
lady, whose protector had been killed by some of our people
in a brawl; but imagine his astonishment, on finding there
the Princess of Lorraine, attired like a little sister of Vincent
de Paule!'
</p>

<p>
I gave the Count a furtive glance of hatred and defiance, to
which he replied by a smile of scornful pride.
</p>

<p>
'M. Blane,' continued the Duke, 'you have been the
means of saving, from the degradation of the Bastille, a
princess of a house which, though menaced now by ruin and
destruction, is fully equal to, and more ancient than, many of the
royal lines in Europe&mdash;a house which, through Marie of
Guelders and Marie of Lorraine, has been twice allied to the
sovereign princes of your own country.  I repeat to you, that
my daughter has told me all&mdash;(<i>all</i> again!)&mdash;and I must seek
the means to repay you&mdash;not for the observance of your word
of honour, pledged to Clara d'Amboise, faithfully to conduct
Mademoiselle here&mdash;but for the unmerited humiliation to
which that duty has been the means of subjecting you.'
</p>

<p>
'I thank you, Monseigneur le Duc.  An exile from my own
country, I have but the inheritance of a Scottish
gentleman&mdash;a poor soldier of fortune&mdash;'
</p>

<p>
'And this, Monsieur&mdash;'
</p>

<p>
'Is my father's sword&mdash;with glory and adversity.'
</p>

<p>
'That sword shall be restored to you.  M. de Bitche,
restore his rapier to M. Blane,' said the Duke, again pressing
my hand; 'Monsieur, I see by the order which you wear,
that you are a man of merit as well as of courage.  What say
you to enter the service of my daughter's intended husband?'
</p>

<p>
'Ah&mdash;she has not told him <i>all</i>,' thought I, bitterly; 'or
Charles IV. would not speak thus to me.'
</p>

<p>
'His regiment of horse lacks a Major&mdash;but you frown;
you Scots are all devoted to the service of France.  Well,
well; I seek not to tempt you from your allegiance; but for
the good deed you have done him, Charles of Lorraine will
ever esteem you as one of his dearest friends.'
</p>

<p>
'Oh Monseigneur, you overwhelm me by this condescension.'
</p>

<p>
'And now, M. Blane, you are welcome to reside at our
palace of Nanci so long as you please.'
</p>

<p>
'Your hospitality, Monseigneur, would endanger my honour
as a loyal soldier,' said I, impatient to leave for ever the home
and vicinity of one who had cost my heart so dear.
</p>

<p>
'Well&mdash;well; the main-body of your army is far from
here, beyond the Rhine, under the Marechal de la Force.
How stand you for funds?'
</p>

<p>
'I am at zero, Monseigneur,' said I; for I had spent so
much in procuring luxuries for my fair companion, that I had
scarcely a denier left.
</p>

<p>
The Duke wrote for me an order on his Comptroller-General
of Finance for a thousand crowns; but when presented, only
fifty were forthcoming; for war and impending conquest had
sorely impaired the resources of his once princely inheritance.
</p>

<p>
He presented me with a beautiful pair of silver-mounted
girdle pistols; and now many gentlemen and cavaliers of his
court, who had hitherto held coldly aloof, pressed around me,
with those compliments and congratulations that flow so
readily from a courtier's oily tongue; but I observed that still
the suspicious or haughty Pappenheim, and the sullen De
Bitche, were resolved to shun me.  After some frivolous
conversation I retired, and was conducted, by M. Schreckhorn,
the Swiss, to my own apartments, where again I seated myself
at the table as before, to ponder over all that had passed.
</p>

<p><br /><br /><br /></p>

<p><a id="chap49"></a></p>

<h3>
CHAPTER XLIX
<br /><br />
DEFIANCE.
</h3>

<p>
The cheers of the people still rang in the streets, where
several puncheons of wine were set abroach by the master of
the household; the contents of these were quaffed by the
German troops, who thereafter, with great liberality, gave the
loyal citizens the purple staves to suck.
</p>

<p>
In my chamber I found my valise, which in the hurry and
excitement of recent events I had quite forgotten, although it
contained the king's despatches to the Duc de Lavalette, and
Sir John Hepburn's baton and diploma as Marechal of
France.  The documents I resolved to secure about my
person for the future, until I could place them in the hands of
those to whom they were addressed.
</p>

<p>
'How came this portmanteau here?' I asked my servant.
</p>

<p>
'An equerry of the Prince of Vaudemont found it, at an
auberge near the Meurthe&mdash;the auberge of the Three Willows;
and M. le Prince at once sent it here, believing it to belong
to monsieur.'
</p>

<p>
'The Prince was right&mdash;I owe him many thanks.'
</p>

<p>
'He left word that he would be proud to see monsieur at
his apartments, on his leaving the presence of the Duke.'
</p>

<p>
'At his apartments&mdash;is he there now?'
</p>

<p>
'Yes, monsieur&mdash;awaiting you.'
</p>

<p>
'Please to conduct me to him.'
</p>

<p>
The servant bowed to the rosettes at his knees, and
preceded me along several passages all panelled with oak, and
decorated in many places by stags' heads and horns, and by
trophies of ancient arms and heraldic devices, amid which the
winglets of Lorraine, mantled, collared and coroneted, were
ever the most prominent ornament.  We reached a door,
before which a page was lounging on a fauteuil, and within
we heard voices laughing and in animated conversation,
sounds that jarred upon my ear, for my heart was sick and
humbled.
</p>

<p>
I was ushered into a large apartment, the walls of which were
hung with rich old tapestry, representing the loves of heathen
gods, and scantily-attired goddesses; and of shepherds and
shepherdesses, with crook and flageolet; but who were much more
occupied with each other than with their sheep, which seemed
to browse among clover composed of cabbages and sunflowers.
Several suits of old armour, numerous stars of burnished
weapons, and two lofty black oak cabinets, profusely carved,
decorated this room, in the centre of which stood a table,
whereon a luxurious luncheon was spread; and here De
Vaudemont, Count Pappenheim and De Bitche, were engaged
in doing every justice to the good things before them.  A
fourth place was vacant, as the page intimated, for me.
</p>

<p>
'Welcome, M. Blane,' exclaimed the Prince, taking me
warmly by the hand, 'welcome, to our ancient home at
Nanci!'
</p>

<p>
'I thank you, M. le Prince.'
</p>

<p>
'Ah, my friend, on that night, when we first crossed our
swords in the Place de la Grève at Paris, who could foresee
to-day, or the gratitude we owe you?  How strangely things
come to pass in this changing world!  And on that night at
Paris, you fought in defence of Marie Louise too, when she
fled from Raoul d'Ische and me, for we believed her to be but
a little grisette, tripping before us in the dark.  You
remember poor Raoul, and his favourite song,
</p>

<p class="poem">
  'Vive le fils d'Harlette!<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Normands,<br />
  Vive le fils d'Harlette!'<br />
</p>

<p class="noindent">
Poor Raoul; he was indeed a gallant spirit!  These are my
friends, M. Blane; this is M. le Comte Pappenheim&mdash;''
</p>

<p>
'The brave son of a brave father,' said I, bowing; but
Pappenheim smiled disdainfully, and played with the shaggy
moustache which covered his upper lip&mdash;a lip thick and coarse,
like that which since the days of the Emperor Maximilian
I. has been deemed fashionable, and even royal, in Austria.
</p>

<p>
'And this is the colonel of my father's petardiers, M. le
Comte de Bitche, whom you have had the pleasure of meeting
before&mdash;'
</p>

<p>
'And whom I have sworn to run through the heart!' I
exclaimed, laying my hand on my sword, and glad to find a
legitimate object on which to pour out all my long pent-up
wrath and bitterness.
</p>

<p>
The Count sprang up, and was about to speak with all the
fury becoming his character and the occasion; when the
Prince exclaimed,
</p>

<p>
'Silence, gentlemen!  The hand that dares to draw a
sword in the palace of Lorraine, is forfeited to the public
executioner.  So be wary, I command you&mdash;be wise, and
become friends.'
</p>

<p>
'Never, while I have breath!' said I.
</p>

<p>
The Count smiled with a provoking expression of contempt,
and gnawed his wiry cavalier moustache.  Then he reseated
himself, and after exchanging sinister glances with Pappenheim,
continued restlessly to pluck and stroke his thick black
lansquenet beard.
</p>

<p>
'M. le Prince,' said Pappenheim, rising proudly and coldly,
'desire your servants to leave the room; I have to make a
communication which they, at least, must not hear.'
</p>

<p>
'Retire, messieurs,' said the Prince, to his valet, and to two
pages, who withdrew, with faces expressive of disappointment.
</p>

<p>
'Comte de Bitche, draw the arras across the doors&mdash;so,
thank you.  I presume there are here no panels or partitions
to which the ear can be applied?'
</p>

<p>
'None; but why all this provoking precaution?' asked the
Prince, with considerable hauteur, for rumours of Pappenheim's
approaching marriage with Marie Louise had caused
the proud Imperialist to receive an adulation, respect, and
flattery from the officers and courtiers of the ducal household,
somewhat galling to the young heir of Lorraine, who viewed
it with mingled jealousy and mistrust; 'M. le Comte, what
the devil do you mean?'
</p>

<p>
'A jealous regard, Monseigneur le Prince, for the honour of
your father's house, and of your sister, Mademoiselle of
Lorraine.'
</p>

<p>
'Milles barbes! what do you say, Count Pappenheim?'
asked Vaudemont, changing colour, while De Bitche gave me
a covert and ferocious smile.
</p>

<p>
'I mean simply <i>this</i>,' replied Pappenheim (who was the
Prince's senior by nearly ten years, and a taller man by at
least half a head), as he came close to him, and spoke in a
hoarse German accent, with his eyes sparkling, and a face
flushed by anger; 'I mean, Prince of Vaudemont, that to spare
this Scotsman's life is in you an act alike unwary and unwise.'
</p>

<p>
'Parbleu! you are mad.'
</p>

<p>
'I am not mad; but I know that death alone can make a
secret sure.'
</p>

<p>
'A secret?' reiterated the Prince, with an air of perplexity.
</p>

<p>
'What secret, Count of Pappenheim?' I demanded, keeping
my hand still on my sword.
</p>

<p>
'I am addressing the Prince of Vaudemont,' replied the
Count, with exasperating hauteur, 'not you, monsieur.'
</p>

<p>
'To the point!' said the Prince, stamping his foot.
</p>

<p>
'I mean that your sister, Mademoiselle Marie Louise of
Lorraine, the intended bride of Wolfgang Count of
Pappenheim, was most unworthily, most unwisely, and most
indelicately, committed by the French king's mistress to this
Scotsman's care, to travel with him together for many nights
and days, these two hundred miles or so, through Champagne
and Lorraine.  You understand me now, monseigneur, I
presume.'
</p>

<p>
'Peace, Count; you alone are unwise and ungenerous, to
noise it thus abroad, and while in anger, too.  The Scot
has performed his trust honourably and faithfully, and for one
feature in the affair only do I feel shame.  That Marie Louise,
when suddenly leaving the court of France on our quarrel
with Louis, had to take refuge with the Lorrainer d'Amboise;
but that woman, though the mistress of the King, is the
daughter of an old and faithful adherent of our house, who
fell by my father's side at Prague; and more honourable
would it have been in Clara d'Ische, and in Mademoiselle my
sister, to have trusted their secret to the honour of M. Blane,
and made him fully aware that the disguised girl he was
conducting to Nanci was the only daughter of Duke Charles IV.,
and not the soubrette of a licentious Parisienne, of mature
age.'
</p>

<p>
'Do not add that as an additional invective, my dear
Prince,' said De Bitche; 'king's mistresses are always dames
of mature age&mdash;it is an historical fact.'
</p>

<p>
'They ought fully and amply to have trusted to him,'
resumed the Prince, without heeding the Count.
</p>

<p>
'I would to heaven they had done so!' said I, in a half-stifled
voice; 'for then much mental misery had been spared
me&mdash;I had never raised my eyes or hopes so high.'
</p>

<p>
'Arthur Blane,' said the Prince, who alone had heard something
of this soliloquy, 'thou art a fine fellow, and a brave
one, and I love thee better every day&mdash;ay, too well to suffer
Pappenheim to do thee wrong.'
</p>

<p>
'I thank you, M. le Prince.'
</p>

<p>
'And I thank you, too,' added Pappenheim, with a courtier's
sneering smile; 'I thank you for the jealous care you have of
your sister's honour, believing, however, it would be all the
greater were you both, as you are not, the children of one
mother.'
</p>

<p>
'Coarse Austrian!' began the Prince, passionately, but
suddenly moderating his tone, he said, 'M. le Comte, your
sneer is alike insolent and unjust, and I repel it with the scorn
it merits.  Mademoiselle is the daughter of a former
marriage, true, and my senior by a year or more, yet do I love
her as my own life, more even than my father does, for all
his hopes and pride are centred upon me, as his only heir.
Beware, Count, how you approach this delicate subject again,
for though pliant as a willow to Marie Louise, you may find
me tough as the mountain oak to her intended husband.'
</p>

<p>
'Enough, monseigneur,' replied the Count, assuming his
plumed hat, and retiring with repeated bows towards the door;
'I shall not renew this subject again, but at the same time
crave leave to choose my own friends, and beg to be excused
sitting at table with your new Scottish ally, with whom I here
proclaim I shall neither make peace nor truce.'
</p>

<p>
'Neither will I,' added De Bitche, retiring also, and from
the door, hurling his leather glove at me.
</p>

<p>
'Take back your glove, De Bitche,' said the Prince,
snatching it from my hand, and tossing it along the corridor;
'and on peril of your life, fight in this matter without my
knowledge.'
</p>

<p>
He closed the door after nis guests, and turning towards
me, said, with a ruffled air,
</p>

<p>
'My poor M. Blane; these two irritable Counts mean you
mischief.  I saw it in their eyes, and De Bitche has the
yellow orbs of a snake.  Milles barbes!  I wish that you were
beyond our lines, among your own people, safely out of
Lorraine, and in the French camp; for these two will leave no
means untried to compass your destruction!'
</p>

<p>
With this comfortable assurance, I seated myself at table;
and we filled our cups with wine.

<h3>
CHAPTER L.
<br /><br />
RATHER POLITICAL.
</h3>

<p>
I now rehearsed, as succinctly as I could, considering the
agitation of my thoughts, my adventures with Marie Louise
on our journey; omitting only such passages as I deemed
might prove unnecessary, or unwelcome.  When I concluded,
her brother expressed much satisfaction, and gave me earnest
thanks, adding that in everything, my relation agreed with
that given by Mademoiselle to himself, and to the Duke.
</p>

<p>
'A further proof that she has not told them all,' thought I,
again.
</p>

<p>
'Now that I have heard your story, and that those blustering
Counts are gone elsewhere to swear and grumble over
pots of Rhenish, or jugs of German beer,' said the gay Prince,
filling up my wine-horn again, 'tell me, how are all my
enemies, the good people of Paris?  Marion de l'Orme,
Ninon de l'Enclos, Louis <i>le Juste</i> (faugh!), and Anne of
Austria; and how is Father Richelieu himself&mdash;the great
master showman in red hat and stockings, who makes all these
little marionettes to hop and dance whenever he pulls the
political strings?'
</p>

<p>
'Marion is still surrounded by lovers, and Ninon ditto,
having quite forgotten the Count de Poligni,' I replied, in
the same bantering tone; 'Louis is still in the silken
meshes of Clara d'Ische; Anne of Austria still makes
confessions to Monseigneur, the Archbishop of Paris, and still
powders, paints, and patches; and eats and drinks as usual with
the regal voracity of a pike; while Richelieu, the Coadjutor's
rival in her heart, still enrols regiments, and levies treasures,
to carry the frontiers of France towards the Rhine.'
</p>

<p>
The expression of Vaudemont's face changed, and his eyes
sparkled at these words.
</p>

<p>
'Louis, most falsely surnamed the Just, is a prince without
honour, and without gratitude!' said he, flinging his empty
silver cup upon the table; 'he is at once the slave and the
tool of Cardinal Richelieu, whom he hates and fears, and yet
obeys&mdash;Richelieu, the most stern and bloody minister that
ever stained the annals of France!&mdash;and now to divert the
attention of her people from the intrigues by which he is
surrounded, and by which he, a presumptuous priest, has
obtained all but the royal authority, he has plunged Louis
into this wanton war with the Empire and Lorraine, on the
bold plea, ever so pleasing to French vanity, that their
frontier shall be the Rhine.  Marched by Champagne, and
bordered by the Rhine, with Burgundy on one hand, and
Luxemburg on the other, doubtless my father's ancient dukedom
presents a tempting morsel to our friend M. le Cardinal and
his creatures&mdash;and to enable them to swallow this morsel with
ease, he has poured five armies into Germany and Italy.
But our people are brave, bold, and hardy; our valleys are
covered by vineyards; our mountains teem with mines of the
richest ore, and hence this old Lorraine of ours&mdash;this
patrimony which we have inherited since the days of the
Merovingian kings&mdash;forms a prize too valuable to be relinquished
to the grasping house of Bourbon: and while we have a
rial and a rapier left, with God's help and the Emperor's,
we shall defend it!'
</p>

<p>
'Louis asserts that Lorraine belongs to him, because Charles
the Simple united it to France in the tenth century, and made
Regnier governor over it.'
</p>

<p>
'Pardieu&mdash;no! 'tis our devil of a Cardinal who asserts this.
But France will not be content with her boundaries at the
Rhine, and if so, where is this spirit to end?  Since the days
of Charles the Great, the French dominions have not had
such prospects of extension as they have now by the schemes
of Richelieu, who has cast his eyes on Lorraine, Alsace,
Brissac, and Philipsburg.  He has cast them over Flanders,
towards Dunkirk; across the Pyrenees, and over Rousillon
into Catalonia.  The annexation of our duchy to France
would bring her frontier forty leagues into the empire; it
would make Louis XIII. master of all the land between the
Saar and the Moselle; it would secure his possession of
Burgundy, and open up his path to the Palatinate; but never
while blood and breath remain to Duke Charles and his son
will they submit to France, and place the coronet of their
independent dukedom under the closed-crown of the imperious
line of St. Louis!  And now, M. Blane, for your own
affairs.  You must be aware, my friend, that the sooner you leave
Nanci, the better for your honour and for your life.  In the
first place rumour may indulge in unpleasant surmises about
your sojourn here; and in the second, I would have you to
rejoin your comrades without delay, lest Pappenhem, this
Æneas of ours who seeks a wife, and his fidus Achates, the
Petardier, who seeks that, which is much the same, mischief&mdash;may
work you evil; for they are at no pains to conceal
their hostility.'
</p>

<p>
'Prince, you speak my very thoughts; I am, indeed,
most anxious to be gone,' said I, though the prospect of
leaving Nanci without a parting word from Marie Louise was
agony to me; yet, fooled and deceived as I had been, what
would a parting word avail me now?  'I will this night
depart for the French camp; but I know not where my
comrades are, or how far I have to travel.'
</p>

<p>
'Morbleu! you do not know where they are?'
</p>

<p>
'No.'
</p>

<p>
'How&mdash;'
</p>

<p>
'You forget, M. le Prince, that I have passed a winter in
the seclusion of the Bastille, where I heard nothing of Paris
but the hum of its streets, far down below my chamber
window.'
</p>

<p>
'The French are still before Elsace Zaberne.'
</p>

<p>
'I think Madame d'Amboise mentioned that siege to me.'
</p>

<p>
'Very probably.'
</p>

<p>
'Colonel Mulheim defends it?'
</p>

<p>
'Ma foi! yes: a valiant Lorrainer, a handsome and gallant
seigneur, who will give them some trouble, for he is as proud
and as obstinate as a Scot or a Spartan.  He will give them
a heavy butcher's bill of killed and wounded to send king
Luis.'
</p>

<p>
'Them&mdash;whom?'
</p>

<p>
'Messieurs Hepburn, Lavalette, and Saxe-Weimar.'
</p>

<p>
'Is he in the field, too?'
</p>

<p>
'You must understand that old Father Richelieu has just
concluded a notable treaty with the Duke of Weimar, who
has bound himself to maintain eighteen thousand Germans for
the service of France, in return for which the Cardinal, with
the greatest liberality, has made him a free and perpetual gift
of <i>our</i> province of Alsace, which was ceded to us by the treaty
of Verdun, and which, though taken from us by the Empire
and given to the Bishop of Strasbourg and its boy-duke, we
still deem ours.  The inhabitants of Zaberne, our principal
city and fortress there, have naturally conceived some objections
to this transference of our rights: thus they are all in
arms, and the walls are obstinately defended by Colonel Mulheim
against some thirty thousand French, Scots, and Germans;
but unless Count Gallas, who is on the march to relieve it and
to form a junction with our troops now here in Nanci, crosses
the Rhine within a week, I fear it must fall; for our couriers
say that Count John of Hanau has been slain; that the walls
were breached on the 9th of June, and that Hepburn's Scots
were clamouring to be led to the assault.  This is now the
14th of June, and by this time perhaps they have planted the
standard of the Louises above the grave of the gallant
Mulheim; for our noble Lorrainer vowed that Zaberne should be
his tomb before it yielded to a foe.'
</p>

<p>
'By what route should I proceed there?'
</p>

<p>
'Any route that will secure you from the snares and
hostility of Pappenheim, in whose eye, when he left us, I read so
deadly an expression.'
</p>

<p>
'Prince,' said I, passionately, as anger and jealousy fired
me, 'I will fight him hand to hand, on foot or horseback,
with sword and pistol, in the public market-place of Nanci, if
you urge this on me more.'
</p>

<p>
'Fight <i>him</i>&mdash;my sister's affianced husband, the love of your
friend, the little Nicola of your romantic journey?  Peste!
Comrade, you must not think of that, but rather study how to
avoid him.  Two roads lead from this to Zaberne,' he added,
taking down from the wall one of those maps of Lorraine and
the Rhine engraved by Ferrari, the then celebrated author of
an epitome of geography.  'I would have you to leave
Nanci to-night, quietly and alone, after dusk, and I will see
that you are well armed and fleetly mounted.'
</p>

<p>
'And the distance to Zaberne is&mdash;'
</p>

<p>
'About twenty French leagues.'
</p>

<p>
'Thanks, M. le Prince.'
</p>

<p>
'You have still four hours left to dine with me and prepare
for your journey; but do me the favour to remain in your
own apartments till I come for you, as Nanci is full of men,
who, like De Bitche, are infuriated against the soldiers of
Louis XIII.  I go to parade my regiment in the great square,
but in two hours will return&mdash;till then, adieu!'
</p>

<p>
'Adieu, M. le Prince, with a thousand thanks for all
your kindness.'
</p>

<p>
We bowed and separated.

<h3>
CHAPTER LI.
<br /><br />
A LAST INTERVIEW.
</h3>

<p>
Vaudemont's page was conducting me to my rooms, when
one of the Duke's gentlemen in waiting, M. René, who wore
the cross of Malta on his dark velvet cloak, met me in the
corridor, with a message to the effect that Mademoiselle de
Lorraine, having heard that I was soon to leave Nanci,
desired that I would favour her with an interview of a few
minutes in the Duke's apartments.  Fortunately the corridor
was dimly lighted; otherwise he of the cloak and Maltese
cross would have remarked how I changed colour at this
announcement.  For a moment, a fierce suspicion flashed upon
me, that this request in the name of Marie Louise was but a
deadly lure of Pappenheim and De Bitche; I had heard of
such snares often, in that time, and in those lands of public
and private assassination.  I was without pistols, but to hesitate
was impossible, and with a bow of assent, I said&mdash;
</p>

<p>
'You mentioned the apartments of Monseigneur?'
</p>

<p>
'Yes, monsieur.'
</p>

<p>
'Is the Duke there?'
</p>

<p>
'No; he has accompanied M. de Vaudemont to parade a
body of soldiers outside the palace.'
</p>

<p>
'I am ready, monsieur&mdash;lead on,' said I, in a voice broken
by the mingled nature of my emotions and all that had passed;
and while feeling my heart sink at the prospect of an
interview with Marie Louise alone, it appeared to me that the
voice and manner of my conductor were characterised by a
strange sadness and sorrow.
</p>

<p>
I stood before her, in one of the loftily-ceiled and
magnificent apartments of that princely dwelling, her father's
ducal palace; and the flush of the summer noon-day's sun
streamed through a painted casement full upon the outline of
her faultless head and form, edging with a dazzling brightness
the golden tresses of her hair, the curve of her delicate neck
and shoulders, and the folds of her white brocade, that fell so
gracefully around her.  All conscious that we breathed the
same atmosphere again, and that I was near her, I approached
with averted eye, until I might have touched her, and then
our glances met&mdash;but oh how timidly and sorrowfully!  Yet I
gazed full upon her, for her soft blue eyes were the bright
stars in which, with all the fond astrology of love, I strove to
read my future destiny.
</p>

<p>
But though their gentleness remained, her bearing was
changed.  It was no longer the timid diffidence, which was
characteristic of the winning Nicola, that I read in them now;
but the clear and full yet chaste expression of a woman of
undoubted rank, and of one who had been long accustomed to
her high position; and pausing, I bowed low, with a humility
that was half mockery, while with a sigh of bitterness and
sorrow, I remembered that I stood before my lost love, the
daughter of Duke Charles IV.&mdash;Mademoiselle Marie Louise,
of Lorraine and Bar-le-Duc, she whom I believed to have made
my honest passion the plaything of an hour.
</p>

<p>
'M. Blane,' said she, in a voice that seemed piercing, for
it stirred my very soul, though it seemed to be rendered
tremulous by her emotions; 'why do you not come nearer,
and give me your hand?'
</p>

<p>
'My hand&mdash;mademoiselle?'
</p>

<p>
'Your hand&mdash;as of old.'
</p>

<p>
'Because we are no longer what we&mdash;were.'
</p>

<p>
'My dear M. Arthur,' said she, trembling excessively as
she clasped my hand within her own; 'what is the meaning of
all this? does not the time seem long&mdash;very long&mdash;since we
have spoken?'
</p>

<p>
'Yet we parted last night, mademoiselle,' said I, with
affected carelessness.  She looked at me earnestly and said&mdash;
</p>

<p>
'Do not speak so unkindly to me, Arthur; but confess that
the time <i>has</i> seemed long to you.'
</p>

<p>
'An eternity!' I exclaimed, as her heart throbbed beneath
my hand, which she pressed against her side; 'but alas,
mademoiselle&mdash;'
</p>

<p>
'Call me Nicola.'
</p>

<p>
'Nay&mdash;nay&mdash;never again.'
</p>

<p>
'We were so happy during those long rides through sunny
Champagne, when you knew me only as poor Nicola&mdash;were
we not?'
</p>

<p>
'And as poor Nicola I loved you&mdash;loved you with a passion
the strength and purity of which are known only to God and
to myself!  Happy?  Oh yes! we were very, very happy,
mademoiselle&mdash;happier than I shall ever be again.'
</p>

<p>
'Do not say so, I implore you?' she exclaimed in a low
voice; while her fine blue eyes filled with tears, and
expressed so much love and melancholy that my soul was moved,
for her.
</p>

<p>
'Pity me, M. Blane,' said she; 'I was then, and am still,
but the victim of circumstances.  The time which I foresaw&mdash;the
time when we would become estranged&mdash;has come to pass
and now you can understand my sorrowful reluctance to hear
you speak of love&mdash;to receive your offers of&mdash;marriage.'
</p>

<p>
'But why did you conceal from me your exalted rank? why
did you not trust me with your name, your title, your
secret mission?  I had then guarded my heart by prudence
and honour too; I would have steeled my breast against you&mdash;.'
</p>

<p>
'Had such been possible,' said she, smiling through her
tears, and still clasping my hand.
</p>

<p>
'Oh, why did you trifle with a love so true as mine, by a
deception so unworthy of us both?'
</p>

<p>
'The Countess d'Amboise, that creature of Louis, who has
the key to his heart and secrets, to whom I intrusted myself
at Paris, (a faithful adherent of ours, if she has no other
virtue) advised me to maintain the character in which I first
appeared to you on that night in the Place de la Grève; and
dearly has that duplicity cost me.'
</p>

<p>
She wept, and still we stood hand in hand.
</p>

<p>
'But whence the name of Nicola?' said I.
</p>

<p>
'My name is Nicola Marie Louise; and I chose the first,
because it was the name of my dear mother, who lies in the
church of St. Epurus; and, moreover, because our patron is
St. Nicolas of Lorraine.'
</p>

<p>
'But this strange sojourn in Paris, mademoiselle?'
</p>

<p>
'I was there when Richelieu suddenly took measures to
grasp the dukedom of Lorraine; and one of his first intentions
was to place me in the Bastille.  Of this Madame d'Amboise
gave me timely notice; I sought shelter with her, but
remained in Paris watching the tide of events.  Lorraine is
my country; it is the patrimony of my fathers; it is the land
of Joan of Arc, and why should not I, in some wise, seek to
serve the soil she sprang from?'
</p>

<p>
'And to this end, you will wed Count Pappenheim, and
duly bestow your bridal garments on the shrine of St. Lucy&mdash;'tis
all wise, proper, and befitting, mademoiselle.'
</p>

<p>
'How cruel in you to speak thus to me!' said she,
upbraidingly; 'to marry Pappenheim, while&mdash;while&mdash;loving
you&mdash;would be to bear about in my heart a load of misery too
terrible for contemplation.'
</p>

<p>
I bent my hot face upon her hand in joy, and kissed it.
</p>

<p>
'I was decoyed from our solitary little auberge at the Three
Willows, by a specious falsehood of the Count de Bitche, who,
in my costume as a sister of Vincent de Paule, did not at first
recognise me.'
</p>

<p>
'And he told you&mdash;'
</p>

<p>
'That you were slain, or desperately wounded.  Oh,
Heaven, how was it that I did not die on hearing his terrible
words, for they ring yet in my ears!  Bitter was the suffering
they cost me!  I rushed from the auberge, and desired him to
lead me to you; but, with one of his malevolent smiles, he told
me, that he had decoyed me for himself&mdash;that it was all a
pretty little snare, that he loved me, and so forth.  I then
threw off my hood, declared my name and rank, commanding
him on his manhood and allegiance to lead me to my brother.
Our worthy petardier knew me then!  Oh, had you seen how
quickly the brutal tyrant changed to the cringing slave!  He
obeyed me; but never can I tell you all I endured until De
Vaudemont gave me tidings of your safety; nor can I
describe the emotions that stirred my heart, Arthur, when I
saw you&mdash;you whom I loved so tenderly&mdash;'
</p>

<p>
'Ah, mademoiselle&mdash;'
</p>

<p>
'When I saw you standing in that crowded street, looking
so wildly and bewildered, crest-fallen, bareheaded, and a
prisoner&mdash;pale, weary, and on foot&mdash;dearest Arthur!'
</p>

<p>
'You <i>did</i> see me then?'
</p>

<p>
'But girt round, hemmed in by iron etiquette, the centre
of a thousand eyes, I dared not even accord a kind glance
towards you.  In courts we learn sorely to school our hearts,
Arthur.'
</p>

<p>
'And to trample on the hearts of others, too.'
</p>

<p>
'You wrong me&mdash;do not say so.'
</p>

<p>
The assurance that she still loved me made me once more
calm; and such is the caprice of the human heart, that, at times,
strange emotions of artificial coldness flitted through my breast.
</p>

<p>
'Arthur,' said she; 'how changed and how diffident these
twenty-four hours have made you?'
</p>

<p>
'Mademoiselle,' I replied, seeing the madness of again
yielding to my emotions; 'I am diffident; because I am not
like that brave Pappenheim, and because my love is sincere,
though it merits no return&mdash;from you, at least.'
</p>

<p>
'What cruel enigma is this?'
</p>

<p>
'Mademoiselle de Lorraine, you are no longer Nicola, the
poor, fugitive soubrette; and in a mere worldly point of view,
you are far, far above me; though I am a gentleman, whose
fathers for six hundred years have borne their crest in battle
on their helmets; yet what have I, an exile, a soldier of
fortune, to offer worthy even a smile from the daughter of
Charles IV., the victor of Prague, and the hero of
Poligni?'
</p>

<p>
'My poor Arthur! you have that which is better than all
the crowns of Europe&mdash;a faithful and true heart; I find that
I must speak for you as well as for myself.  Marie Louise
cannot lose that heart, which she won as Nicola.  Love has a
language that cannot be expressed by words alone; thus your
tenderness and diffidence, even with the poor soubrette, were
the surest indication of the depth of yours.'
</p>

<p>
'Oh, yes!' said I, clasping my hands; 'my love is
equalled only by your beauty and your merit.'
</p>

<p>
'Now,' she exclaimed, almost playfully, 'you must not be
imitating Ronsard.'
</p>

<p>
'I am in agony, and you speak to me in jest.'
</p>

<p>
'And so you would not give one golden hair of Nicola's
head for Louise of Lorraine, with all her rank and beauty?
Oh, poor M. Blane, what say you now?'
</p>

<p>
'Jesting yet!  I say that I think so still, and yet&mdash;my
heart, God help me, feels broken.'
</p>

<p>
'Come&mdash;come&mdash;allons!' said she, waving her pretty white
hand; 'be a man, Arthur; what say you to join my father,
and fight under the standard of the Emperor?'
</p>

<p>
'By the side of Pappenheim and De Bitche?'
</p>

<p>
'No.'
</p>

<p>
'What then?
</p>

<p>
'By the side of Vaudemont and Duke Charles.  In France,
your Scottish Hamiltons are Dukes of Chatelherault in
Poitou; your Forbeses are Lords of La Faye; your Douglases
are Dukes of Touraine and Lords of Longoville; your
Stuarts are Lords of Aubigne, Governors of Avignon, and
Dukes of Calabria.  Why may not you become a count or
prince in our duchy of Lorraine?'
</p>

<p>
'Impossible!'
</p>

<p>
'Why impossible?'
</p>

<p>
'Because the days of Lorraine as a duchy are doomed, and
because I am a soldier of France.  Tempt me not, for my
honour&mdash;'
</p>

<p>
'Will be dear to me as my own; so I pray you to excuse
me,' said she, while her tears fell fast,
</p>

<p>
'To-night, Louise, I go, never to return; but my soul I
give to God&mdash;my sword to France&mdash;my heart to you.'
</p>

<p>
'You are going&mdash;' she faltered.
</p>

<p>
'Yes.'
</p>

<p>
'Whither?'
</p>

<p>
'To the French camp, before Elsace-Zaberne.'
</p>

<p>
'Alas!'
</p>

<p>
'Your rank forbids me even to hope,' said I.
</p>

<p>
'Then love will soon die.'
</p>

<p>
'Nay, nay! give me leave to seek a field where I may fall,
if I cannot forget you.  I leave this to-night, and take the
road by Sarrebourg and Phalsbourg towards Alsace.  Oh,
Marie Louise! in memory of the love I have vowed and you
have accepted, think of me sometimes; and in memory of the
pleasant days we have passed&mdash;of all I hoped, and all that never
can be&mdash;give me one kind kiss before I leave you for ever!'
</p>

<p>
We opened our arms, and were about to meet, when simultaneously
we caught sight of a tall man, wearing a mantle and
star, a long feather and sword, who stood between the parted
arras of the doorway, observing us with sinister eyes, while
quietly smoothing his large collar of fine Flemish lace, and
lounging against the door-post.
</p>

<p>
'Count Pappenheim!' I exclaimed, instinctively placing
my hand into my sword-hilt.
</p>

<p>
'At your service, Monsieur l'Abbé, or Monsieur Scaramouche,
by the devil's death! which you please.'
</p>

<p>
How long had he been there?  How much or how little he
had heard of our interview, of her abhorrence for him and
her love for me, of my route and purpose, I knew not.
Quick as lightning, I asked these questions of myself, and
sternly made a step towards him.  He gave us a malicious
smile, and with a bow of profound irony, said&mdash;
</p>

<p>
'Mademoiselle de Lorraine and M. Blane, allow me kindly
to end an interview, which, under all the circumstances, seems
to have been sufficiently painful and prolonged.  The Duke,
your father, mademoiselle, sent me, as his most fitting
messenger, to say that he would speak a few words with you, on
a matter of the first importance to us both; thus I doubt not
that our very good friend of the Garde du Corps Ecossais will
excuse us.'
</p>

<p>
This style of deportment, in which hatred, jealousy, and
rage were skilfully veiled under a bland but ironical exterior,
left me nothing more to urge at that time; and we bowed
mutually, as with a heart swollen by fury, sorrow, and envy,
I saw him take the cold white hand of the girl I loved&mdash;of
Marie Louise&mdash;and lead her away.  I was left alone, with
nothing of her but the memory of her parting glance, which
was so full of agony and expression, that I seem to see it still
before me, even now, after the long lapse of many, many
years.

<h3>
CHAPTER LII.
<br /><br />
THE CHAPEL IN THE WOOD.
</h3>

<p>
So ended my painful interview with Marie Louise.
</p>

<p>
The lofty air assumed by this presumptuous Austrian lord
rankled in my breast like a poisoned arrow!  I longed to
meet him alone&mdash;alone on the solitary highway, or in some
deep and voiceless solitude, in any sequestered place where
there would be none to see or to separate us; and where,
with sword and dagger, we might prove which was the better
man, or which was the greater braggart of the two.  For the
present, there was nothing for me but to retreat, leaving him
in quiet possession of the battlefield and of the contested prize,
alas! for hope, had I none!  That fickle fortune would ever
afford to one so humble, a prospect or a plea for disputing her
hand and love with the son and heir of Pappenheim, the rival
of Tilly&mdash;he whose pride made him spurn even the Golden
Fleece was more than a madman's dream.
</p>

<p>
Had the gallant old Duke been severe upon me as his
prisoner&mdash;nay, had he even been less kind&mdash;I would have left
nothing undone to carry off his daughter and wed her in the
face of France and the Empire; but the demeanour of Charles
IV. was too conciliatory to spur or foster such a thought
of treachery in me.
</p>

<p>
After a residence in Paris, during that age of dissipation
and vice when virtue and religion were alike made a
mockery, it charmed me to find that, with all her beauty, her
natural wit and shrewdness, Marie Louise was so innocent
and so amiable.  In short, I knew not which dazzled me
most&mdash;her vivacity of thought and grace of expression, the
beauty of her person, or the purity and sincerity of her heart,
which (unchanged as when first I met her) loved me still, with
a regard which was strengthened by a sentiment of pity for
the deception of which I had been the dupe, and for the
wrong that had thus been done me.
</p>

<p>
But Pappenheim had certainly overheard a considerable
portion of our interview: he might thus know my route to
the French camp, and put in practice some foul treachery;
for I believed that he and his compatriot, De Bitche, were
capable of any atrocity.
</p>

<p>
I exchanged my cassock for a good buff coat, trimmed with
broad bars of silver lace, a cuirass, and gorget, which, together
with a basinette of tempered steel, were given to me by De
Vaudemont.  I charged carefully my pistols, the recent gift
of his father, examined the locks, and then placed them in
my girdle, with a good dagger and sword.  My papers and
despatches I had already secured in a secret pocket; and the
Prince, as he placed in my hand a passport signed by the
Duke, told me that the master of the horse had selected
the best steed in the ducal stables to replace the fine Spanish
barb so wickedly destroyed by De Bitche.  My old
travelling-cloak, with a Spanish beaver, I presented to Sergeant
Asfeldt, and a dear gift they proved to him in the sequel.
</p>

<p>
'You go by Dieuze and Sarrebourg?' said the Prince.
</p>

<p>
'Yes; but would not a route by Rosiers and Luneville be
safer?'
</p>

<p>
'It would be a longer detour; but as for the safety, I do
not see much difference.  De Bitche has property and
adherents both at Luneville and Rosiers, and I suspect him
of conspiring with Pappenheim, so keep well to the left of the
main road to Elsace-Zaberne.  They have just had a long
conference in the court-yard; I watched them from a window,
and the moment it was concluded, De Bitche departed
towards the bridge of the Meurthe, with ten petardiers of his
company on horseback.  Thus, I fear me, the Luneville road
may be beset, and pray you to be wary.'
</p>

<p>
'Beset by De Bitche?'
</p>

<p>
'Sacre, yes!'
</p>

<p>
'A curse on him and on all his generation.'
</p>

<p>
'It will not mend the matter: but in case you are actually
watched, leave Nanci to-night, as pre-arranged; but do not
set forward, lest there be an ambuscade on one or both of the
roads.  There is an old chapel of St. Nicolas in the Wood,
a mile below the city, on the right bank of the river.  A
pathway diverging to the left near an old stone cross leads
directly to it; there you can remain till morning, and then
ride boldly forward.  You will have a long summer day's
march before you, and by nightfall may see the ramparts of
Elsace-Zaberne still glittering, I hope, with the helmets of
Mulheim's brave Lorrainers.'
</p>

<p>
I thanked Vaudemont, and bade him adieu with a depth of
feeling that must have surprised him; but he was the brother
of her I loved more than all the world beside; and, moreover,
with all his recklessness and devil-may-care spirit, he was a
gallant and generous youth, who struggled nobly but vainly in
after years to regild the faded glories of his house.
</p>

<p>
I rode from the palace and through the principal street of
Nanci, that my departure might be seen by all who felt any
interest therein; and quitting the city by one of its northern
gates, trotted along the well-wooded highway, that led
towards the frontier.  At the stone cross, which stood near a
well, I turned my horse, as directed by the Prince; and after
throwing a sharp glance round me, to assure myself that no
secret eye was upon me, I descended into a dell, covered by
thick dark copsewood, and rode rapidly in search of the
ancient chapel, in which, like a hero of the Round Table, I
was to pass the night alone.
</p>

<p>
The sun had set beyond the valleys of the Meuse and the
Moselle, and the last gleams of the west bathed with a
saffron tint the walls and towers, the spires and ducal palace,
of Nanci, as they rose to the eastward of my path, above
green groves of full-bearing orange and plum trees.
</p>

<p>
Torrents of rain had recently fallen amid the woods and
snows of the Vosges: thus the waters of the Meurthe were
swollen, and I heard their current roaring in full flood as
they rolled through the echoing woods of the valley I
traversed.
</p>

<p>
Rising amid the coppice, on a knoll, I found the chapel of
St. Nicolas&mdash;a plain but sturdy old Gothic structure, the low
round arches, zigzag ornaments, and grimly-grotesque carvings
of which declared it to be coeval, perhaps, with Charles,
Lord of Lower Lorraine.  It contained an altar and shrine of
St. Nicolas, before both of which some oil-lamps, that were
nightly lit by the old canonesses of a neighbouring establishment,
were burning and sputtering in the currents of air.  I
unbitted and stabled my charger, relaxed his saddle-girths, and
left him in one of the stalls built near the porch for the horses
of visitors.  Entering, I shut the door, rolled my cloak round
me, and with my sword, pistols, and a flask of good brandy,
endeavoured to make myself at ease, after dropping a few
coins into the visitors' box, lest I might depart with the shades
of night and forget all about it on the morrow.  I then composed
myself to sleep on a bench at the lower end of the chapel.
</p>

<p>
The altar lamps flickered and flared in the currents of wind;
but, as my eye become accustomed to their feeble light, the
features of the chapel grew gradually clearer to my eye, and
many a stone visage that was hideously grotesque, seemed to
laugh and wink to me, from the carved corbeilles of the roof,
and the massive bosses that clasped the interlacings of the
groined arches.  St. Nicolas, with a halo of gilded iron round
his head, stood quaintly out in bold relief from the painted
wall on one side; on the other, framed in marble, shone a large
sheet of polished copper, whereon was written a complete
history of the battle fought before the walls of Nanci in 1475 by
Charles the Hardy, Duke of Burgundy, who, with the flower
of his followers, was there slain by the soldiers of René, Duke
of Lorraine.  On this plate were graven the names and
armorial bearings of all the Burgundian knights who perished
with Duke Charles; and the list closed by a request that the
pious reader would pray for their souls, as their bodies were
all interred in this chapel of St. Nicolas.
</p>

<p>
There were certainly more pleasant places wherein to pass a
night than that old chapel, with all its buried dead and gloomy
associations of desperation and defeat; but Scot though I was,
and deeply imbued, moreover, by that superstition which few
of my countrymen are without, I thought not of the hacked
helmets and knightly bones that lay beneath me, or of the
chances of spectral appearances, as the mid-mirk hour of the
night approached&mdash;as the air waxed colder and the altar lights
grew dim&mdash;I thought only of my own wayward fate; of the
strange passages of my life during the last few years; of the
dangers I had escaped and those I might yet encounter; of
Louise, whom I loved so well&mdash;who loved me in return, but
from whom I seemed hopelessly separated for ever.
</p>

<p>
How much more enchanting than the large and voluptuous
Clara&mdash;she who for a time had so dangerously dazzled me&mdash;was
the smaller and more delicately-formed Marie Louise&mdash;half-woman
and half-angel; like a poet's dream, a Raphael's
happiest thought!  So perfect in her purity of form; so
beautiful in face, expression and thought.
</p>

<p>
'Ah, Marie Louise, there is none other like you in the
world!' thought I, with mingled rapture and bitterness.  'Who
ever loved me so well?  Yet we shall never see, never meet,
never hear each other's voice again!  I can be reckless enough
in battle now, for I have no mistress for whom to spare myself.'
</p>

<p>
The exhaustion of long toil and deprivation of rest, now
began to steal over me, and I had fallen into a doze, to dream
of Louise as Nicola, when a sound roused me, making me start
to full and nervous wakefulness, as the whizz of the first shot
in action might do.  I started!  My horse was neighing in its
adjacent stall, to me a signal sufficient that other nags were
near.  I thought of De Bitche with his ten petardiers, and
cocked my pistols.  I heard the hoofs of a horse ringing, as it
was galloped down the path, across the wooded valley, and
drawing nearer as it approached the chapel, till at last the
sound become dull and muffled on the sward.  I boldly threw
open the chapel door to confront this midnight visitor, and by
the dim light of the stars without, and the flicker of the altar
lamps within, beheld a handsome young man, mounted on a
powerful grey horse, with his cloak muffled up to his nose and
his hat pulled down to his eyes; but I soon perceived that he
wore the long moustache and pointed <i>royale</i>, peculiar to the
court of-Louis XIII.
</p>

<p>
'Hark you, M. le Chevalier!' said he.
</p>

<p>
'Who are you?' I asked.
</p>

<p>
'I am René, Knight of Malta, one of the Duke's gentlemen
in ordinary.  I had the pleasure of conducting you, monsieur,
to the presence of my foster-sister to-day.'
</p>

<p>
'You mean Mademoiselle de Lorraine?'
</p>

<p>
'Marie Louise&mdash;yes.'
</p>

<p>
'And you are her foster-brother?'
</p>

<p>
'Yes, monsieur; my mother nursed her; I have taught
mademoiselle to ride; to throw off a falcon, and to shoot with
the arbalest à jallet, as we name a little crossbow for throwing
clay pellets.  Were not such tasks a happiness?'
</p>

<p>
'M. René, I envy you; but what seek you here?' I asked,
with suspicion.
</p>

<p>
'I sought you, M. Blane, and I am happy to find that you
are not gone.  Are you not afraid of being robbed in this
solitary place.'
</p>

<p>
'I am afraid of nothing, M. René; fifty crowns are all I
possess in the world.'
</p>

<p>
'But one's skin is of some value, and that may be perilled
in these woods among wolves and outlaws.'
</p>

<p>
'To the point, M. le Chevalier de Malta,' said I,
suspiciously; 'it was not merely to tell me all this you sought
me.  Perhaps you bring a message from Wolfgang Count
Pappenheim?  If so&mdash;&mdash;'
</p>

<p>
'What then?'
</p>

<p>
'You are doubly welcome.'
</p>

<p>
The eyes of the Lorrainer sparkled.
</p>

<p>
'No, monsieur,' said he, 'I am not in the habit of bearing
messages for M. Pappenheim; he is one for whom I have but
little love&mdash;&mdash;'
</p>

<p>
'Give me your hand, my dear M. René.  I request to
be admitted to a copartnery in that abhorrence.'
</p>

<p>
'You hate each other, then?'
</p>

<p>
''Tis to avoid his assassins I am this night quartered like a
paladin of old in this enchanted chapel; for being in a wood,
it must, of course, be enchanted.'
</p>

<p>
'Yes; it is said that the spirit of Charles the Hardy stalks
forth every night at twelve o'clock, side by side with René of
Lorraine, both cap-a-pie.'
</p>

<p>
'Well, twelve is long since past by my watch, and neither
of these personages have gone forth, unless they have done so
unseen by me.  And so you, too, are at enmity with Pappenheim?'
</p>

<p>
'Enmity deep, bitter, and undying!'
</p>

<p>
'We are allies,' thought I; 'but, the devil! we may be
rivals, too!'
</p>

<p>
'In a dispute when hunting, Count Pappenheim, who is a
rough and unlicked German cub, dared to strike me with his
riding-rod&mdash;I, René of Gondrecourt, knight of Malta.  Oh,
M. Blane! but for the solemn vow which binds me to my
order, and but for the marriage which is about to be
celebrated between him and mademoiselle my foster-sister,
this dagger had laid him dead beside the deer which was the
matter in dispute.'
</p>

<p>
'No vows bind me, dear René,' said I, pressing the hand
of the young Chevalier; 'and when Pappenheim and I meet,
my sword, I hope, shall write on his plump German hide a
full and fair apology for all our wrongs.'
</p>

<p>
'We heard of a strange accident just before I left the
palace.  The Count de Bitche and ten of his petardiers left
Nanci on horseback this forenoon abruptly, and without the
Duke's orders took the road to Luneville.'
</p>

<p>
'Indeed!' said I, becoming suddenly interested.
</p>

<p>
'Sergeant Caspar Alsfeldt of Vaudemont's musketeers&mdash;&mdash;'
</p>

<p>
'A brave and kind old fellow; he brought me prisoner to
Nanci.'
</p>

<p>
'Well, he was despatched with an order for their immediate
return; but they mistook him for some one else, as he was
dressed in a strange hat and cloak, so they fired and pistolled
the poor man about sunset, and he is now lying dead on the
road, about three miles from Nanci.'
</p>

<p>
'My brave sergeant! he fell into the trap intended by the
villains for me; for doubtless the hat and cloak he wore were
mine.  I may well thank Heaven for the foresight of
Vaudemont.'
</p>

<p>
'Hence, M. Blane,' said René, grasping his reins, 'mademoiselle,
my foster-sister, sent me to conjure you, by God's
love and her own, to leave this place without delay, and to
accept this little note, which contains her farewell to you.
Adieu, monsieur&mdash;or rather au revoir, for we shall meet again
in our helmets during some of those fine summer days on the
banks of the Rhine.'
</p>

<p>
As he said this, René placed a note in my hand, put spurs
to his horse, and, from the chapel door, rode down the
wooded valley.  The note was written on perfumed Dutch
paper, tied crosswise by white ribbons, and fastened by a
little red seal, bearing the winglets under a coronet.
</p>

<p>
I cut the ribbons with my dagger, and trembled as I read
the note, by the dim flickering light of the altar.
</p>

<p>
It bore the signature of Marie Louise, and was written by
herself, assuring me of her unalterable regard, and that death
itself were more welcome to her than this projected union with
Pappenheim: it contained little; but began by desiring me to
forget her, and, like a dear paradox, ended by begging me to
remember the pleasant days we had passed together, and
though separated, to think kindly of her, as she would never
cease to think of me but with sorrow and love.
</p>

<p>
This little billet occasioned in me the usual burst of
transport such evidences of affection generally develop in
lovers, all of which the reader knows very well; and I was
carefully refolding, after reading it for the tenth time, when a
sound caught my ear.  I listened.  It was a distant clock
striking the hour of four.  I looked up, and saw that already
the altar lamps were sinking and about to expire, and that
grey dawn was beginning to shine through the painted windows
of the old chapel.
</p>

<p>
'Now,' thought I, 'let me to my saddle, and with whip
and spur make this new nag of mine believe that he has Satan
himself on his back!'
</p>

<p><br /><br /><br /></p>

<p><a id="chap53"></a></p>

<h3>
CHAPTER LIII.
<br /><br />
THE TOWER OF PHALSBOURG.
</h3>

<p>
When I rode from the chapel of St. Nicolas in the Wood
the morning was cool and delicious.  The forests were clothed
with luxuriant green foliage, that rustled pleasantly in the
rising wind.  The Meurthe flowed majestically through the
broad and fertile valley between banks that teemed with
fertility, or were covered by groves of wild apricot, plum, and
orange trees.
</p>

<p>
Distant a mile or so rose Nanci, its old ramparts and
plastered houses standing in relief against the cold sky, clear
and white in the pale light of morning, for the sun was yet
below the horizon, and the lingering stars that still twinkled
amid the deep blue vault were reflected in the depths of
the river that bathed the palace walls, while the sharp
pinnacles of the cathedral spire cut the sky-line as they towered
above every other feature of the city.'
</p>

<p>
'Adieu, Marie Louise,' said I, kissing my hand to the
distant palace, as its casements began to gleam like plates of
burnished gold; and as I crossed a wooded ridge, where the
road suddenly dipped down towards the town and fortress of
Château Salines, so famous for its saline springs, where salt has
been manufactured since the days of Thierri of Alsace.
</p>

<p>
Riding rapidly without hindrance or molestation for twenty-two
miles, I passed Dieuze between the banks of the Seille and
another river, and then past Sarrebourg, a quaint old town
which was quietly ceded to France by the Lorrainers in 1666.
It is situated on the right bank of the Sarre, which flows from
the wooded Vosges to the Lower Rhine, and is only fifteen
miles westward of Elsace-Zaberne.  I halted here at an
hostelry named <i>L'Image de Notre Dame</i>, the sign-board of
which had been riddled by the bullets of Saxe-Weimar's Swedish
Protestants.  This house of entertainment stood immediately
opposite the palace of Henri de Vestingen, the Archbishop of
Treves.
</p>

<p>
Though now so near my destination, a stupid crayfisher, of
whom I unfortunately inquired the way, misdirected me; and
at nightfall, instead of being at the end of my journey, I
found myself in a wild and sequestered district among the
mountains, where the patois of the peasants&mdash;of whom I met
but two&mdash;was so quaint and barbarous that I could scarcely
understand one word they uttered.  To make all this more
unpleasant a storm was coming on; the sky grew black and
lowering; the air was full of electricity, and warm rain-drops
fell heavily and at long intervals.
</p>

<p>
After a time I found myself close to a small, compact, but
closely-walled town in a deep valley of the Vosges.  I
approached the gate joyfully, and heard a sentinel challenge in
pure French; but still precaution on my part was necessary.
</p>

<p>
'Stand,' cried he, 'or I shall fire.  France or Lorraine?'
</p>

<p>
To answer for either was dangerous; so I inquired,&mdash;
</p>

<p>
'What town is this?'
</p>

<p>
'Phalsbourg, on the frontier of Alsace.'
</p>

<p>
'How far is Zaberne distant?'
</p>

<p>
'Six miles to the north-east.'
</p>

<p>
'Then I have ridden fifty-four miles to-day.'
</p>

<p>
'From where, my friend?'
</p>

<p>
'Nanci.'
</p>

<p>
'Ha! from Nanci&mdash;indeed! well, pass on&mdash;do not advance
one step, or I shall be compelled to fire.'  The match
of his arquebuse glowed in the dark, as he blew it to enforce
the threat.
</p>

<p>
'Is this garrison French or Imperialist?' I asked.
</p>

<p>
'Return in the morning, and we shall each see what the
other is like.  Good night.'
</p>

<p>
'Good night;' and I rode off, as nearly as I could judge, in
the direction of Zaberne; and now the warm rain plashed in
my face, and I heard the rising wind begin to roar in the
hollows, and saw the ghastly green lightning playing about
the black peaks of the Vosges.
</p>

<p>
Phalsbourg, belonging to princes of that title, who were
vassals of Duke Charles, stands on an eminence overhanging
a deep and narrow defile of these mountains.  It is strongly
fortified, and was founded for defence by Count John, Palatine
of the Rhine in 1570, but was annexed to France by the
treaty of Vincennes, when ruin was deepening on the fated
house of Lorraine.
</p>

<p>
As Zaberne was only six miles distant, I deemed it wiser in
me to ride on and endeavour to reach the French lines, than
perhaps to fall into a trap by attempting to make good a
night's quarters in Phalsbourg; but the storm of rain came on,
and this, together with the darkness of the night and my total
ignorance of the way&mdash;no one being abroad to act as guide&mdash;caused
me to ride almost at random for several miles along a
rocky and devious path, until I reached a pile of buildings
that rose in the centre of the way, and I found myself before
a castle&mdash;one of those huge, fortified mansions of the middle
ages, having walls of enormous height and thickness, with
dungeons below, battlements above, gates and drawbridges in
front.
</p>

<p>
A passing gleam of lightning revealed to me a lofty square
tower defended by outworks, having a deep ditch, palisadoes,
and a drawbridge, which was up.  It was evidently the castle
of some Alsatian noble, probably a vassal of the Bishop of
Strasbourg, to whom the province of Alsace at one time
belonged.  Being furnished with letters from king Louis on one
hand, and with a passport from Duke Charles on the other, it
now occurred to me that I should be pretty safe in venturing
into this feudal tower, whoever might be its lord; and half
choked by wind and rain, and tired of struggling to keep in
check my horse, which swerved and plunged at every flash of
lightning that reddened the sky and threw forward in full and
sable outline the huge square mass of the castle.  I hallooed
loudly, but my voice was swept away by the wind; till,
waiting for a lull, and gathering all my strength, I placed a
hand to my mouth, and shouted thrice again.
</p>

<p>
'Halloo!' answered a voice from the outworks; an arched
gate opened; I saw the glow of a red light flaring on the wet
walls without, and on the swampy fosse below, while three or
four armed men applied their hands to the counterpoise of the
drawbridge, and with a clang lowered it into its socket.  As I
approached the wicket of the strong pallisadoes, it was carefully
closed, and a voice demanded&mdash;
</p>

<p>
'Whence come you?'
</p>

<p>
'From Nanci direct.'
</p>

<p>
'You are alone?'
</p>

<p>
'As you see, quite alone.  Come, come, my friend, do not
keep me long at parley in such a storm of wind and rain.'
</p>

<p>
'But what seek you here?'
</p>

<p>
'Shelter; what the devil would one seek else in such a
night as this?'
</p>

<p>
'Enter,' was the gruff reply.
</p>

<p>
I rode in, and found myself in an archway, off which
opened two vaulted guardhouses, full of armed men.  The
bridge was wound up; the barriers were closed; I gave my
horse to a groom, and found myself housed in the castle of&mdash;I
knew not whom.
</p>

<p>
'How name you this fortress?' I inquired of one who
seemed to bear some authority, if I might judge by his
polished cuirass and triple-barred helmet.
</p>

<p>
'The tower of Phalsbourg, monsieur.'
</p>

<p>
'And who commands here?'
</p>

<p>
'An officer of the Duke of Lorraine.'
</p>

<p>
'Good; lead me to him, I am furnished with papers from
Monseigneur le Duc.'
</p>

<p>
'This way, monsieur, follow me.'
</p>

<p>
As we proceeded through the archway, across the court and
entered the keep, neither the enormous thickness of the walls
nor their height surprised me so much as the great number of
well-armed men who crowded all the chambers, or were
lounging on wooden benches, smoking, and polishing their
accoutrements, in the whitewashed corridors, which were
lighted by candles, placed in reflecting sconces of bright tin.
However, I remembered the time and situation; that this was
a frontier castle, garrisoned by Duke Charles against the
French; and I recalled, too, the magnificence and military
state maintained by the French nobles, even in time of peace,
and of this, the style of the Marechal Duke of Sully, Grand
Master of the Ordnance and Governor of Poitou, when living
in retirement at his castle of Lillebonne, may serve for
an example.  He had constantly about him one company of
French guards, and another of Swiss, who attended him on
horseback when he went abroad, on which occasions the great
bell of the castle was rung, a bombarde fired, and all his
servants stood in two lines, bareheaded, from the staircase to
the outer gate.  At table, two guards, with partisans, attended
nim, and only two chairs were placed there, one for him and
another for his duchess, while their guests, no matter how
high their rank or long their lineage, were merely
accommodated with stools without backs.
</p>

<p>
As we ascended to the hall of this fortress, the sound of
loud laughter, occasional oaths, and the rattle of dice-boxes,
met my ear, while the fumes of wine, a close atmosphere,
rendered more oppressive by the light of many lamps and
the breath of several debauchees, saluted me, and on entering
I beheld a very remarkable scene.
</p>

<p>
The hall was lofty, and hung with gaudy Haarlem tapestry.
</p>

<p>
It was crowded by cavaliers in rich and variously-coloured
dresses of Blois and Utrecht velvet, laced with gold and
silver; most of them had on cuirasses and gorgets, and all
wore swords, daggers, and silver-mounted pistols, hung by
swivels or hooks to their girdles.  Many of these men were
too evidently intoxicated.  Some smoked, or sang, or slept on
the side benches; a few were intent on gambling at a table
apart; others were drinking wine or beer from vessels of all
kinds, and some were engaged in coarse banter or dalliance
with four or five gaudily-dressed and profusely-painted
demoiselles, who, if they had been found in the Scottish camp of
Marshal Hepburn, had assuredly been sent to ride the wooden
horse at the quarter-guard.
</p>

<p>
Among the armed men present, I recognised the Swiss
officer, M. Schreckhorn.
</p>

<p>
'Place, messieurs, place for a gentleman from Nanci!'
exclaimed my conductor; and all turned towards me with
interest and surprise, and several said&mdash;
</p>

<p>
'M. le Commandant! where is M. le Commandant?'
</p>

<p>
'Here,' growled a voice, as a tall, swarthy man, who, with
his laced pourpoint unbuttoned, and his black hair dishevelled,
had been asleep on a fauteuil, started up, and I found myself
confronted with the Count de Bitche.
</p>

<p>
He uttered a shout of savage and half-drunken laughter;
while, with a sinking heart, I found that, by my own
unwariness, I had fallen into a deadly trap at last.

CHAPTER LIV.
<br /><br />
DE BITCHE.
</h3>

<p>
'M. l'Abbé, alias M. Blane de Blanerne, alias M. Scaramouche
le Moucharde, welcome! most welcome to share the
hospitality of Phalsbourg!' exclaimed De Bitche, twisting up
his enormous black moustache; 'by Beelzebub, but this is a
most unexpected pleasure, for we had quite given up all hope
of seeing you again!'
</p>

<p>
'Perhaps so, M. le Comte, after murdering a poor soldier,
in mistake for me, on the Nanci road.'
</p>

<p>
'Your predilection for wandering outside your own camp
is marvellous; but we must cure you of it.  Corboeuf!  I
would that Pappenheim were here, to share with me the
pleasure of giving you a welcome.'
</p>

<p>
When I gazed on the demon-like eye of this infamous
noble&mdash;a strangler, a gambler, and debaucher&mdash;I almost
believed in the sorceries and diablerie imputed to him by the
simple peasantry of Alsace and Lorraine.
</p>

<p>
'Well, mon condottiere,' continued the Count, in his
bantering manner; 'you gaze at me curiously&mdash;you
remember having met me before, I think?'
</p>

<p>
'Those who once behold your face, will never forget it;'
said I, making a violent effort to repress my growing anger.
</p>

<p>
'Oh, milles demons! one could not be mistaken then?'
</p>

<p>
'No, M. le Comte&mdash;those who once see your visage, will
never behold another like it.'
</p>

<p>
'Especially if they are in your perilous perdicament.  You
walk stiffly&mdash;your spurs drip blood.  By St. Nicholas!
M. Blane, you have ridden fast from Nanci; but not fast enough
to escape me, who left it before you; though six miles further
on you would have found Messieurs Hepburn and Lavalette,
peppering Zaberne (a bitter reflection certainly) with culverin
and caliver.  Had your horse wings?  But we shall not
inquire.  My dear M. Blane, I have you here snug enough,
and here you shall remain; for unless you write me a little
billet to my dictation, I shall hang you like a dog.'
</p>

<p>
'Hang?' I exclaimed, laying my hand on my sword.
</p>

<p>
He nodded his head, adding,
</p>

<p>
'Unless you pen for me a little billet.'
</p>

<p>
'A billet?'
</p>

<p>
'Milles demons! yes&mdash;I speak plain enough.'
</p>

<p>
'To whom?'
</p>

<p>
'Mademoiselle de Lorraine,' said he, in a hoarse whisper.
</p>

<p>
'Count, you are a villain!'
</p>

<p>
'M. le Commandant!' exclaimed at least twenty men,
knitting their brows and grasping their swords.
</p>

<p>
'Nay, nay, gentlemen,' said he, 'be patient, I pray you.
It is a defect of these Scots to be somewhat plainly spoken.'
</p>

<p>
'And to be truthful too,' I said with ungovernable fury,
while unsheathing my sword; but it was barely out of the
scabbard, when the rough hands of a crowd of armed men
were laid upon me, and in a moment, I was denuded of my
belt, with its poniard and pistols, my sword and purse of fifty
crowns, with all my papers, while I was held so tightly on
every side that I could scarcely breathe.  My despatches were
valueless to me, compared to the farewell note of Marie
Louise.
</p>

<p>
'M. le Comte,' exclaimed a bloated young subaltern of
Swiss, who was looking over my papers; 'here is a letter from
mademoiselle&mdash;'
</p>

<p>
'De l'Orme&mdash;yes!' interrupted De Bitche, abruptly, closing
the sentence to mislead his followers, and snatching the
letter of Louise from the startled discoverer thereof; 'and on
peril of your life,' he added, 'speak no more of it.'
</p>

<p>
'But, M. le Comte,' said Schreckhorn, 'here is a protection
from Monseigneur le Duc, dated at Nanci, yesterday.  This,
at least, must be respected.'
</p>

<p>
'A vile forgery&mdash;put it in the fire; every spy has papers.'
</p>

<p>
The protection given to me by Vaudemont was then
consigned to the flames.
</p>

<p>
'And here is a despatch sealed with the royal arms of
France, and addressed to M. le Chevalier Hepburn, marshal
and general of the Scots with the army of the Rhine.'
</p>

<p>
'Bon&mdash;diable! give me that!' shouted De Bitche, making
a snatch at the envelope, which contained the brave Hepburn's
diploma of Marshal of France; 'and now away with the
moucharde to the turret above the river; but, off with his
buff coat first.  Aha, messieurs! 'tis laced, and of the true
Parisian cut.  Off with it, for by the favourite corn of
St. Nicolas, he will never need it more!'
</p>

<p>
My buff coat was rudely torn off me by some half-drunken
Swiss and Germans, among whom it formed an object of
furious contention.  I was then dragged through the hall,
along a dark passage, and up a narrow stone stair, to a little
arched door, through which I was thrust into an apartment
lighted only by fitful gleams of the moon, across which the
stormy clouds were hurrying in black masses; and there left
to my own anxious and alarming thoughts.
</p>

<p><br /><br /><br /></p>

<p><a id="chap55"></a></p>

<h3>
CHAPTER LV.
<br /><br />
THE TURRET.
</h3>

<p>
My first impulse was to look from the window of this apartment.
It was large for the window of a turret, but so closely
grated that the iron bars, together with its height from the
ground, precluded all chance of escape either by rope or
ladder, if I had them.  The fire-place was also enclosed by a
complicated iron-grating, so that the chamber seemed peculiarly
adapted for retention, escape by the chimney being even
contemplated and provided against.  The storm was dying
away; the rain ceased to lash the walls and batter on the
windows.  I could see the steep brows and black defiles of
the Vosges, over which the murky shadows of the clouds and
the wavering gleams of the moon were flitting.  Lofty and
dusky these mountains were&mdash;dark and solemn too, seeming
to approach as the moonlight gleamed along their rocky
steeps, and anon receding into gloom as the crape-like clouds
wrapped up the moon in their pall of murky vapour.
</p>

<p>
Morning soon began to dawn; and, as the sun came up, the
storm, with all its clouds and shadows, its gusts of rain and
wind, retired westward over the mountains, together with the
gloom of night.
</p>

<p>
The steep Vosges looked green and bright, with all their
thick waving woods and chestnut groves, many of these
mountains being clothed from base to summit in foliage.  In the
valleys and defiles between them, nestled little thatched
hamlets, bordered by rich meadows, by flower gardens, and by
pastures of emerald green; in others I saw the lurid gleam of
furnaces, where the copper-ore was smelted in mines that were
old as the days of Hilderic, King of the Franks, who was lord
of all Alsatia.
</p>

<p>
As the morning brightened and the day wore on, voices
loud and clamorous came at times along the corridor from the
hall, mingled with the tipsy shrieks and coarse laughter of
women.  These sounds gave me vague alarm.  De Bitche
and his ruffianly companions might be arranging and planning
my death; and the contemplation of enduring a lonely and
helpless murder at their hands filled my soul with a sickly
horror which it is impossible to portray.
</p>

<p>
I knew the cruelties of which the Imperialists were capable.
I knew that Colonel Sir James Ramsey, one of Scotland's
best and bravest officers, was enclosed by them in a chamber of
the castle of Dillingen, on the Danube, and there starved to
death&mdash;he a prisoner of war, taken gallantly in battle under
the Swedish banner.  I knew that, like Caribs or Mohawks,
these Austrians frequently murdered or mutilated their
prisoners.  At New Brandenburg they put a whole Scottish
garrison to the sword, and tore the heart of Major Dunbar
from his breast.  At the dreadful sack of Magdeburg they
rent the children from their mothers' wombs before they
burned them both.  In Saxony they roasted men before slow
fires; in Silesia they boiled them like lobsters, to force them
to discover hidden wealth; and in Lower Germany, committed
such atrocities as were enough to bring a curse upon
the house of Hapsburg.
</p>

<p>
My comrades were only six miles distant; twenty, perhaps
thirty, thousand men were there, who, to save me, would
each man have lent a hand to tear Phalsbourg from its
foundations.  This was a bitter, an agonising reflection!  But that
Marie Louise might never know the barbarous death I
suffered for her sake was the bitterest thought of all!  The
hope of acquainting the Prince of Vaudemont of my danger
was as vain as the chance of my being able to communicate
with the besiegers of Zaberne; vain as the prospect of escape
when I looked from the barred window of the lofty turret and
saw the scarped hill and valley, overhung by the castle, a
hundred feet below.
</p>

<p>
So, amid these reflections, the long night had passed away;
morning came without sleep once visiting my eyes; and
I felt neither hunger nor thirst, nor fear at times, but only a
fierce impatience to have the last act of this diabolical drama
played out.  I knew that I was in the hands of desperate men,
and had but one desire&mdash;that, if I was to be sent untimeously
out of this world, the malevolent De Bitche should not remain
in it behind me.  But I was without a weapon, and saw
nothing that could be made one.  With this thought I threw
a hurried glance around my room.
</p>

<p>
The walls were covered by tapestry, which hung on tenterhooks,
and represented a banquet of the gods, whose scanty
costume displayed a considerable oblivion of decency.  They
were hideously grotesque and mis-shapen; but were regaling
themselves on every variety of fish, flesh, and fowl, and were
quaffing water from huge Rhenish tankards.  Round the
cornice were the arms, crests, and mottoes of the princes of
Phalsbourg and the counts palatine of Lutzelstein, with whose
family the former had intermarried, and whose castle stands
on the skirts of the Vosges, but six miles nearer the frontier
of Lorraine.
</p>

<p>
In a distant defile of the hills a gleam caught my eye: it
wavered at first, but came again and again steadily.  It was
the glitter of arms; and, with a keen glance and an anxious
heart, I watched that glitter sparkling afar off like a beam of
hope: that it came from the arms of soldiers on the line of
march I had no doubt.  Anon it disappeared, but gave a new
current to my bitter imaginings.

<h3>
CHAPTER LVI.
<br /><br />
THE LETTER TO MARIE LOUISE.
</h3>

<p>
The morning stole away and noon drew near: no food was
brought to me; but I did not miss it then, my mind being so
agitated by alarm and useless regrets.  I was agreeably
surprised that the unscrupulous soldiers into whose hands I
had fallen did not pistol me as a spy, for De Bitche had
given them every reason to believe me one; but that worthy
personage had ulterior motives for sparing me so long.
</p>

<p>
About noon he entered my chamber abruptly, and carefully
closed and double-locked the door on the inside, placing the
key in the pocket of his buff coat.  He then threw off his
blue velvet cloak and large beaver hat, which was adorned by
a long red feather, and surveyed me sternly.  His aspect was
in some respects handsome, but his form was colossal, and his
bearing imperious.  His eyes expressed an excitement which
he endeavoured to veil under his usual cruel smile; but a
black expression and sinister glare hovered in them.  His
lower jaw was deep and square&mdash;a feature generally indicative
of brutal strength and strong passions.  In his waist-belt
were placed a pair of pistols and a poniard without a sheath.
He made an ironical bow to me, to which I replied by drawing
my figure up to its full height, and loftily giving him a
frown of contempt.
</p>

<p>
'I have had tidings from Zaberne this morning,' said he;
'Mulheim still holds out bravely, though Count Gallas has
failed to relieve him; and so this night the Chevalier Hepburn
means to attack Phalsbourg.'
</p>

<p>
'This night! are you sure of that?'
</p>

<p>
'Sure as that I now address a&mdash;dying man.'
</p>

<p>
I smiled scornfully.
</p>

<p>
'Oh, smile on, monsieur!  His troops are now in sight:
horse, foot, and artillery coming to the attack.'
</p>

<p>
'Their arms had been the gleam I saw among the
mountains.  This night, you say&mdash;'
</p>

<p>
'Nay, this very day&mdash;perhaps within an hour, the castle
may be taken.'
</p>

<p>
'And I?'
</p>

<p>
'Shall be by that time buried deep enough below the
pavement of the court, perhaps.'
</p>

<p>
'What do you mean, villain?  They will take the place by
storm.'
</p>

<p>
'Do not flatter yourself; for on reflection, M. Blane, I
think they will not.  I have made every disposition for a
vigorous defence.  Let ten thousand come, they are welcome
to Phalsbourg.'
</p>

<p>
'You have some purpose, Count, in visiting me this morning?'
</p>

<p>
'Of course; I was about to allude to it.'
</p>

<p>
'And this purpose?'
</p>

<p>
He smiled, and insolently surveyed me from head to foot.
</p>

<p>
'Count de Bitche, I demand to be liberated, or to be treated
with the courtesy usually allotted to a prisoner of war.  My
parole&mdash;'
</p>

<p>
'Liberated! that you may go back to Paris, and coquette
with the King's mistress, to sup in her boudoir, to toy with
her full fair arms, her chestnut hair, and adjust the sachet <i>à la
violette</i> in her bosom!  Bah!  Pardieu, my fine fellow, you
shall have no such indulgence.  So, so, among your papers I
have the honour to find a letter from Mademoiselle de Lorraine.
</p>

<p>
'Insolent!'
</p>

<p>
'Well, I have something to propose, which, from the tenor
of that letter, must, I presume, afford you pleasure.
</p>

<p>
'Indeed!' said I, reading the wicked sneer of his heart in
his eyes; 'how kind of you, M. le Comte!'
</p>

<p>
'Very!'
</p>

<p>
'And this proposition&mdash;out with it.'
</p>

<p>
'Is merely that you should answer that letter.'
</p>

<p>
'You mock me, Count; never, while subject to your
surveillance&mdash;never, while a prisoner in Phalsbourg.'
</p>

<p>
'Peste! we shall see that,' replied De Bitche, with a coarse
laugh, as he twisted up his moustache, and continued to speak
in this style, amusing himself with my situation, as a cat
plays with the mouse it means to devour; 'you love Mademoiselle
de Lorraine?' said he, with mock softness.
</p>

<p>
'You are the last man in the world to whom I would make
any such admission.  Neither do I wish to hear her name
from your polluted lips.'
</p>

<p>
'Mighty well, mon brave!' said he, with flashing eyes;
'we shall see how long this gallant bearing lasts.  You would
do anything to serve mademoiselle; you would even lay
down your life to insure the happiness of hers, I presume?'
</p>

<p>
'I would&mdash;Heaven knows I would, with joy!'
</p>

<p>
'Oh! 'tis a mere trifle that, when we love a woman; so I
shall give you, my dear fellow, an opportunity of performing
that pretty trifle.'
</p>

<p>
'What do you mean, M. le Comte?' said I, making a step
towards him; but he placed the table between himself and
me, and kept a hand on his pistols.
</p>

<p>
'You shall see.  But ha! what is that?'
</p>

<p>
'A shot&mdash;another and another!' I exclaimed with joy, as
we heard three dropping and distant shots.  Then followed
the closer rattle of musketry, and the sound of a drum beaten
rapidly.
</p>

<p>
'And now hark!  My fellows answer from the tête-du-point;
your comrades have come within range; they are, I
repeat, most welcome to Phalsbourg.  Anon I will be with
them.  And now for you: mademoiselle knows your
handwriting?'
</p>

<p>
'She does&mdash;having frequently seen it at Paris.'
</p>

<p>
'And your signature too, probably?'
</p>

<p>
'Yes.'
</p>

<p>
'Then take pen and ink, and write after me.'
</p>

<p>
'Excuse me, M. le Comte,' said I, trembling with exultation,
as I saw a brigade of French artillery, consisting of ten
pieces of cannon, on field carriages, with tumbrils and waggons,
each drawn by four horses, pass at full gallop along the green
brow of the opposite hill, while the head of a column of
infantry appeared beyond it, with pikes glittering and standards
waving.  Then the ordnance were wheeled into position, as the
cannoniers and fire-casters sprang from their seats, unlimbered
and proceeded to load.  'Excuse me,' I continued, 'but there
are some features in yonder landscape so very interesting that
I must look for a moment.'
</p>

<p>
'Yonder preparations are of no moment to you,' said De
Bitche, stamping his foot and growing pale with anger, as he
drew a pistol from his belt and cocked it, 'take up that pen
and write as I dictate, or'&mdash;and he swore an oath too frightful
for me to repeat&mdash;'I will lay you, where I have laid many a
better man,&mdash;dead at my feet.'
</p>

<p>
I glanced at the Count and measured his strength with my
own, which it far surpassed, for his proportions and muscles
were gigantic; I measured too the distance that lay between
us; by one bound I could have cleared it, but a bullet would
reach me with the rapidity of light.  A contest with a man
more powerful than myself by one half, and one who was so
well armed, while I, faint with toil, was quite defenceless,
would have been recklessly to throw away all chance of safety
and escape; and now, while the roar of falconets on the
bartizan overhead shook the keep from cope to groundstone
while the French cannon opened from the brow of the opposite
hill, I dipped the pen in the ink, and gave the Count a furious,
glance to which he replied by an insolent laugh, and pointing
with the muzzle of his loaded pistol to a sheet of fine white
Dutch paper, said&mdash;
</p>

<p>
'Begin, monsieur, for I am leaving M. Schreckhorn alone
to contend with those friends of yours, the feather-bed soldiers
of Louis XIII.  Begin thus&mdash;
</p>

<p>
'<i>My dear Mademoiselle de Lorraine&mdash;</i>'
</p>

<p>
Curious to learn what he had in view, and moreover to gain
time, I slowly wrote the preamble, and he continued to dictate,
amid the concussion of the adverse artillery, which shook the
old feudal castle to its basement.
</p>

<p>
'<i>Now that I am beyond the reach of your many attractions, a
sentiment of remorse compels me to inform you that the love I
profess to bear you</i>&mdash;have you got all that down, my young
moustache?'
</p>

<p>
'Yes, M. le Comte&mdash;proceed.'
</p>

<p>
'<i>The love I have professed to bear you is alike absurd and
futile.  Mademoiselle, you have lavished all the young affection of
your pure and noble heart upon a vile, a false, and worthless object;
for I tell you, with shame and contrition, that I am already the
husband of a pretty citoyenne of Zaberne&mdash;</i>'
</p>

<p>
'But this is an infamous falsehood, Comte!'
</p>

<p>
'Proceed, I command you,' replied De Bitche, levelling his
pistol across the table, and throwing a furious glance at the
French cannon, the shot from which were coming over the
valley with a sound between a boom and a scream.
</p>

<p>
'<i>That I desire you will cease to think more of me, and pardon
the presumption of one who is every way unworthy of you; who begs
to return your letter, and to subscribe himself, Mademoiselle, your
most devoted servant&mdash;&mdash;Done at Zaberne&mdash;</i>'
</p>

<p>
'But this is Phalsbourg?'
</p>

<p>
Again the black muzzle of the pistol threatened me.
</p>

<p>
'<i>The 15th day of June&mdash;God and our Lady take you into
holy keeping</i>.  And now, M. Blane&mdash;your signature in its usual
fashion.'
</p>

<p>
'Rascal!' thought I; 'so this is the plan of your little
campaign?'
</p>

<p>
'Your signature&mdash;your signature,' he continued, pressing his
finger upon the trigger of the loaded pistol.
</p>

<p>
A cold perspiration burst over me.  I was like one who is
in a partial stupor, with a pressing sense of death and danger
from which escape was impossible.  I knew that if I delayed
to sign he would shoot me in his rage; and that if I signed the
letter, either by a real or feigned signature, it would prove my
own death-warrant, for then I should also be shot, instantly
perhaps, while the document thus extorted from me, would be
duly forwarded to Marie Louise, and being dated from Zaberne,
would remove all suspicion of force or fraud, and cast obscurity
over the place and manner of my murder, and in her mind
disgrace my memory for ever.
</p>

<p>
These were dreadful reflections to crowd into one short
moment of time; but to gain one moment more was, to me, of
priceless value.  In one hand I held the extorted letter; in
the other the still wetted pen.
</p>

<p>
'Sign&mdash;sign or die!'
</p>

<p>
I signed my name carefully, and slowly blotted it with
blotting-paper, seeking a moment when the withdrawn pistol
would enable me to spring at the throat of De Bitche; but
alas! that moment never came.

<h3>
CHAPTER LVII.
<br /><br />
THE RANDOM SHOT.
</h3>

<p>
My life hung by a hair, as it were; but this thorough-paced
bravo was too wary for me.
</p>

<p>
Before I could either rush upon him, or tear the
document to pieces, he snatched it from me, and thrust me
furiously back by the muzzle of the loaded pistol, which, by
heaven's mercy, rather than his, did not explode.  He then
placed the letter carefully in his breast, and dragged me by
the throat&mdash;for his power and strength were far greater than
mine&mdash;to the window.
</p>

<p>
'Look your last upon your friends, for in ten minutes I
will hang your dead body from the tower-head, and the ravens
of the Vosges may be picking your bones, when Mademoiselle
Louise is reading your letter.  Presumptuous fool,&mdash;who
dared lift his eyes in love to the bride of Pappenheim&mdash;to a
daughter of the house of Lorraine!  But on receiving this
letter, with its enclosure, she will cast you from her heart and
memory, and accept with joy the lover chosen by her father
and the Emperor.  Look&mdash;what do you see?'
</p>

<p>
'Coward!' I exclaimed, 'coward and villain!  Ah! if
Hepburn knew I was here?'
</p>

<p>
'And would it avail you?' he asked, while his eyes filled
with a dusky light, and I felt his hot, and snake-like breath
on my face; 'but 'tis not Hepburn who commands yonder.'
</p>

<p>
'Who then?'
</p>

<p>
'Roger de St. Lacy, the Duc de Bellegarde.  See! yonder
is his regiment, the dragoons of Brissac, with an infantry
battalion of Picardy.  Look ye, Scot, and look well,' (here
his voice trembled, and grew hoarse, with an emotion so wild
and fierce that I believed him to be mad or drunk with wine
and pride,) 'for I tell thee by the God who hears us, thou
seest the last of war, and all its terrors&mdash;of the sun, and all
his glory!'
</p>

<p>
He suddenly raised the pistol to my head&mdash;
</p>

<p>
There was a screaming sound&mdash;a tremendous crash, as if
the solid keep had rent beneath our feet to its deep foundations,
and I was thrown, breathless, and stunned for a time,
on the floor.  In a minute, or less, sense returned, and the
knowledge of immediate danger restored my energy.  I
staggered up, and looked around me.
</p>

<p>
A cannon-shot&mdash;whether discharged at random, or because
our figures had been seen struggling at the large window of
the turret, I know not; but this cannon-shot&mdash;an eighteen-pound
ball&mdash;had entered the aperture, dashing it to pieces,
and tearing, as if it had been a gossamer web, the strongly
interlaced bars of the iron grating, half-buried itself in the
stone-wall beyond us.  A large splinter of the grating, and a
fragment of stone, had struck De Bitche on the breast and
right arm, hurling him furiously on the floor, and causing the
pistol, with which he was threatening my life to explode, and
send its bullet through the ceiling.  He was lying on his back
and breathing slowly, with his eyes half-closed, and so far
turned back within their sockets, that the white of them alone
was visible.
</p>

<p>
Amid the din of the cannonade, and the many sounds which
filled this fortified tower, the crash of this random shot, and
the report of the pistol were unnoticed or unheard.
</p>

<p>
De Bitche was moaning heavily, and when I placed a foot
upon his breast, a half-stifled sob escaped him.  I surveyed
him steadily, and I fear me furiously, as with something like
a laugh of exultation, I possessed myself of his girdle, with
its poniard, and remaining pistol; and I now deem it
singular, that in the revulsion of my emotions, and in my fury
and despair, having so many affronts to avenge; I did not then
and there beat out his brains with my heel, or strangle him
by placing my foot on his neck to destroy him as I would have
done a wild beast.  I placed the loaded pistol to his head, and
said,
</p>

<p>
'Recover your senses as quickly as possible, M. le Comte;
'I have little time for trifling.'
</p>

<p>
'Viper!' he groaned, 'it is <i>your</i> turn now.'
</p>

<p>
'And believe me, I shall not neglect it,' I replied,
spurning him with my foot; 'ha&mdash;ha!  M. le Comte, I hope your
mother has been forgiven&mdash;'
</p>

<p>
'For what, fellow?'
</p>

<p>
'For bringing into the world, a villain so unparalleled as
you!  Now, hear me.  You have in your possession a letter
which you compelled me to write a few minutes ago&mdash;to write
with this pistol at my ear.  You will please to deliver up that
letter?'
</p>

<p>
He hesitated.
</p>

<p>
'The letter!' I hissed through my teeth; 'or, by heaven!
I will cut off your head with this dagger, and toss it through
that shattered window.'
</p>

<p>
By the left hand he drew it from his breast, and in doing
this, I perceived by a futile effort he made to move the right
arm, that it was <i>broken</i>.  I carefully tore the letter into the
smallest pieces, and scattered them about.
</p>

<p>
'Good! now M. le Comte, I have another favour to ask.
The letter of Mademoiselle de Lorraine?'
</p>

<p>
This he also delayed to give; but the pressure of my foot
on his breast, proved an argument so persuasive, that he was
forced to yield, and I carefully consigned it to my breast.
</p>

<p>
'Now, M. le Comte, I have still another little favour to
ask; the pass-word for the day&mdash;the parole&mdash;speak, or die! ha,
ha! a minute ago, it was you who said, "sign or die;" the
parole?' I added, fiercely, 'or I will crush you, like the worm you
are&mdash;ay, strangle you as the Lady of Lutzelstein was strangled.'
</p>

<p>
A frightful pallor came over his damp visage at this threat,
and under his heavy black moustache he faltered out&mdash;
</p>

<p>
''Tis the name of the Emperor.'
</p>

<p>
'<i>Mathias?</i>'
</p>

<p>
'Yes.'
</p>

<p>
'And the countersign?'
</p>

<p>
Again he delayed.
</p>

<p>
'Quick&mdash;quick.'
</p>

<p>
'<i>Vienna.</i>'
</p>

<p>
'Good&mdash;now I have done with you, until your arm is cured,
and we can meet again in our helmets, and under better
auspices; and then&mdash;dog, coward, and murderer&mdash;be wary of the
worthless life a mistaken humanity causes me to spare
to-day!'
</p>

<p>
Regardless of his broken arm, and of the sickening agony it
caused him, I bound his hands behind him by his waist-belt.
I then tore his scarf in two; tied his heels by one half, and
with the other gagged him, in such a position, that he could
neither summon aid nor give an alarm.  I then possessed
myself of his violet-coloured velvet mantle, and broad Spanish
hat, and tearing out the scarlet plume by which it might be
recognised, armed with his poniard and pistol, I left the chamber.
</p>

<p>
On withdrawing, I gave him a farewell glance; and never
did I read in human eyes, the snaky, fiend-like expression of
hatred, rage, baffled spite, and bodily agony, that glared in
those of the bruised and fettered De Bitche, when I left him
with a fierce and mocking laugh.  I double-locked the
chamber-door, and as I crossed the deserted hall, flung the key
into a fire of wood that blazed on the hearth, under the arched
fireplace.
</p>

<p>
'Now,' thought I, 'my tormentor is secure enough!'
</p>

<p><br /><br /><br /></p>

<p><a id="chap58"></a></p>

<h3>
CHAPTER LVIII.
<br /><br />
THE SALLY.
</h3>

<p>
This sombrely tapestried and stately apartment seemed at
first quite unoccupied; and for a moment the idea of throwing
burning faggots on the floor, and setting the hated tower on
fire, occurred to me; but the desire of effecting my own
escape lay nearer my heart than the destruction of Phalsbourg.
Moreover, I observed one who had escaped my first survey, a
woman, asleep, or in a swoon on a bench; a tipsy courtesan
of the last night's orgies, and an emotion of pity restrained me.
Arming myself with a sword, I rushed to the court-yard, which
was crowded by the garrison, and was then the scene of all the
infernal hurlyburly incident to a furious assault and vigorous
defence.
</p>

<p>
'Mathias and Vienna,' I repeated; 'these are the magic
words which are to set me free; but amid this vile uproar who
is to receive them&mdash;to whom can they be given?'
</p>

<p>
Finding their shot too light for battering purposes, already
the French cannoniers were beginning to slacken their fire
against the donjon of Phalsbourg, the old grey walls of which
had long been worn by time, and battered in war.  I gave an
upward glance at the square projecting turret, where my proud
and boastful enemy was lying, bruised, bound, gagged and
everyway baffled, humbled, and secured.  Then hurrying
forward, I joined the crowd of armed men who were lining
the walls of the tête-du-pont.  Here eight iron 24-pounders
were pouring a close and destructive cross-fire against the
companies of the regiment de Picardy, then moving up to
assault the rampart, and bearing ladders to cross the ditch,
though the musketry from the tower told fearfully upon their
ranks.
</p>

<p>
To prevent recognition, I partially blackened my face by
gunpowder; possessed myself of a dead man's musket and
collar of bandaliers, and stepped upon the platform, within
which the killed and wounded men lay thick.  I had scarcely
taken my place upon the parapet, when a small shell, or
bombelle, exploded in the air, just above my head.  Some of the
fragments fell on me, but without doing harm.  Then I fired
a few blank rounds, to gain time, or to enable me to observe
what was going on; and there I ran considerable risk; for the
hat, so recently borrowed from my friend M. le Comte, was
torn off my head by a musket-shot.
</p>

<p>
Situated on rocks, that are steep and inaccessible on every
side save the west, the tower of Phalsbourg is approached
by a narrow causeway, which is cut by a deep ditch; and
along this causeway, under a fire from the flankers which
defended the drawbridge, the regiment de Picardy;&mdash;that noble
old band, of immortal memory&mdash;advanced valiantly and resolutely
to the escalade, with loud shouts of, 'Vive Louis le
Roi!  Picardy to the assault!  Picardy to the assault!'
</p>

<p>
They rushed to the edge of the trench, undeterred by the
withering rain of lead that swept the causeway, piling it with
dead and wounded men, many of whom rolled over it, down
the defile on one hand, or into a foaming mountain-stream on
the other,&mdash;on, on they came, led by their officers,
splendidly-attired chevaliers in steel cuirasses, and velvet pourpoints,
perfumed, laced, and ruffled; and at their head came one,
whom before I had observed, with remarkable sangfroid, to be
alternately caressing his horse's neck, and playing with his
own hair, which was long and ringleted, like the tresses of a
girl.  On foot he now led the stormers, with a little standard
of the fleur-de-lis in his hand; on his breast was the cross of
the Holy Ghost, and in the band of his hat there was stuck a
lady's fan.  By the latter, I knew him in a moment to be
Roger de St. Lacy, Colonel of the regiment de Brissac, a
brilliant and determined soldier, for whom one of the fairest
coquettes at the court of France had procured the title of
Duc de Bellegarde.
</p>

<p>
He had already reached the edge of that fatal fosse, and,
brandishing his sword, shouted 'Picardy to the assault! forward
with the ladders! forward my braves!  Vive Louis
le Roi!'
</p>

<p>
There a shot struck him!  I saw the crimson blood spout
over his white uniform, as he bent forward and fell headlong
into the ditch.  This shot was fired by one beside me: I
turned, and beheld M. Schreckhorn, the officer of Swiss, in
the act of reloading his arquebuse, with a grin of triumph;
and I had some difficulty in controlling my first impulse to
brain him with the butt of my musket.
</p>

<p>
Here also fell the Sieur de la Rivière, captain of French
musketeers, who having, it was affirmed, neglected to put on
his scapular, was shot through the very place where the
Madonna's picture would have hung.  He was brother of the
celebrated Abbé de la Rivière, who, at this very time, having
lost the royal favour by visiting Clara d'Amboise, was sent
to the Bastille to study practical philosophy and new periwigs
together.
</p>

<p>
Under a storm of lead and iron, the leading company had
already thrown themselves into the fosse, and were planting
their ladders against the sloping stone glacis of the redoubt,
when Schreckhorn flung among them a <i>pate de grenades</i>, or
earthen pot, filled with gunpowder and grenades, having iron
spikes upon them; while at the same moment the petardiers
of De Bitche, like brave and reckless fellows as they were,
lifted bombs in their hands, lighted their fuses, and, with all
their force, hurled them over the parapet into the crowded
fosse below, where they exploded with the <i>pate</i>, destroying,
tearing to pieces the unfortunate stormers, and paralysing
the rest, who were already sufficiently disheartened by the
loss they had sustained, and by the fall of their brilliant
leader.
</p>

<p>
The assault was abandoned, and a precipitate retreat
succeeded&mdash;a retreat galled by a fire of cannon, muskets, and
arquebuses, from the ramparts of the tower and its outworks;
while the stubborn Swiss, the fierce Imperialists, and
infuriated Lorrainers, who composed the garrison, about eight
hundred in all, raised a wild and tumultuous hurrah; for
never before had the regiment de Picardy been known to
retreat.  Schreckhorn flung down his musket and drew his
rapier, exclaiming, 'Lorraine and the Emperor!  the Emperor
and Lorraine!  A sortie! volunteers for a sortie!  Fall in,
my comrades! fall in!'
</p>

<p>
A tumultuary mass of musketeers, pikemen, and Swiss
halberdiers, about four hundred strong, formed in something
like military order, and led by Schreckhorn in person, now
rushed towards the barrier gate of the tête-du-pont; and with
this mass I mingled, taking care to keep well in the rear
ranks, and to avoid being conspicuous, resolving on the
earliest opportunity to conceal myself, or feign death.  But I
soon abandoned the last idea; for, when we crossed the
drawbridge, I beheld, to my horror, the brutal Swiss and
Austrians murder all the French wounded by braining them
with the bolls of their halberds or the butts of their muskets;
and in this villany M. Schreckhorn set the example, by twice
passing his sword through the body of the Sieur de la
Rivière.
</p>

<p>
The fall of the Duc de Bellegarde prevented proper measures
being taken to secure a retreat.  Already the French
artillery were far down the valley, retiring at a trot towards
Zaberne, and (fortunately for those who composed the sortie)
escorted by the dragoons.  The regiment de Picardy was
following them in confusion, their rear maintaining a
desultory fire with our front, as we proceeded over broken and
rocky ground, on the skirts of a chesnut-wood, near a steep
cliff, at the foot of which the mountain river ran with a
hoarse and brawling sound.  Here I took an early opportunity
of loitering in the rear; and seeing a large pile of
dried branches and withered leaves collected together by
some woodman prior to removal, I first affected to drop a
shoe, and, when adjusting it, contrived to be left completely
in the rear.  Then, instead of rejoining, I concealed myself
in the heap of forest spoil, drawing in my musket after me,
and concealed every portion of my person as carefully as if I
had been tucked in, like a babe in the wood, by the kind birds
of the popular ballad.
</p>

<p>
At that moment the regiment De Picardy made a stand,
and I heard their drums beat a charge; then followed some
heavy firing, and their musket-shot crashed among the trees
overhead, and, with a dull, heavy sound, tore up the ground
near me.  I lay still and breathless.  With a fierce shout, the
sally from Phalsbourg fell back before their sudden volley.
I heard two men speaking near me in a hoarse and guttural
language.  Heavens!  One stumbled over the heap of
leaves&mdash;I was discovered&mdash;no; not yet!
</p>

<p>
They proved to be two of Schreckhorn's Swiss musketeers,
who had just come out of the castle to enjoy a little shooting
at the French; and kneeling behind the pile which concealed
me, they proceeded deliberately to exchange a few rounds of
ball-cartridge with certain musketeers of Picardy, who were
nestling in rear of a rock, at forty yards' distance.  The Swiss
fired with coolness shot after shot close to my ear, casting
about and reloading their long heavy muskets; while the
bullets of their adversaries crashed among the stones or
branches, whitened the stumps of the trees, tore up the turf,
and knocked about the dry leaves which concealed me.
</p>

<p>
Imagine my situation and my feelings while this continued;
to find myself reduced to the position of a fascine, a sand-bag,
a parapet for those devils of Swiss to fire over!  In lying
still I risked the bullets of my friends; in starting up to seek
safety by flight, I risked death at the hands alike of friends
and foes; and while I lay thus, with a palpitating heart and a
reeling brain, at least twelve shots whistled harmlessly about
me, and five or six knocked the withered leaves into the air.
</p>

<p>
At last the distant firing grew fainter; the regiment de
Picardy was retiring!  My heart began to beat more equally,
and with less pain.  My friends the Swiss shouldered their
muskets and were proceeding to advance, when one of them,
in stepping over the pile of leaves, placed a foot on me with
such force and suddenness, that a faint cry of pain escaped
me.  They started back with a shout of alarm, which brought
to the spot several of their comrades; and I was immediately
pulled from my lurking-place, to find myself confronted by
M. Schreckhorn, and other officers of the garrison, who were
mustering the skirmishers.
</p>

<p><br /><br /><br /></p>

<p><a id="chap59"></a></p>

<h3>
CHAPTER LIX.
<br /><br />
THE PAROLE.
</h3>

<p>
Inquiries were first made as to whether I was wounded;
then as to who I was, my rank and name&mdash;for my attire, to
say the least of it, was rather peculiar, and my face was still
begrimed with powder.  A glance showed me the situation in
which I was placed.
</p>

<p>
The brow of the cliff, on which I stood, overhung the
stream that brawled through the wooded defile, past the
square black tower of Phalsbourg; further off, down the
valley, lay the little fortified tower of that name, and beyond
it were the Vosges, green, dun, or brown, but all huge and
many shadowed, piled peak on peak, fading and mellowing
away in the distance.  On the other hand, the wooded defile
opened out into a broad and sunlit valley, clothed with waving
vineyards.  This valley led towards Zaberne; and there I
could see the discomfited infantry of king Louis, halted at
the distance of a mile; but whether preparatory to renewing
the attack, or to retiring, I know not.  Nearer were the
dragoons of Brissac, who had now fallen back to cover the
rear of their foot; and nearer still were ten cavaliers in
brilliant trappings, whose helmets and corslets, as they
caracoled to and fro in the green meadows as if loth to retreat,
flashed back the rays of the morning sun.  On beholding
them, a new impulse awoke within me, for I believed them
to be ten gentleman of the Garde du Corps Ecossais, and
eventually, my surmise proved correct.
</p>

<p>
Around me, and scattered over the brow of the grim cliff
which overlooked all this panorama, were the prostrate forms
of some twenty or thirty soldiers, killed or wounded in the
skirmish; and close by me, were the men of the sally, falling
into their ranks preparatory to marching back to the tower,
under the orders of M. Schreckhorn's second in command.
</p>

<p>
A rapid and hopeless glance told me all this; and then I
turned to meet, and if possible to baffle, the suspicious
questions of the warlike Switzer, who wore a quaint old jagged
suit of harness of the last century, and carried a pair of long
pistols in his leathern girdle, while he wielded one of those
enormous halberds, to which the countrymen of Tell have
been so partial in all ages.
</p>

<p>
'Who are you, monsieur?' asked Schreckhorn, in his
execrable French.
</p>

<p>
'Faith, I can scarcely tell,' said I.
</p>

<p>
'A peculiar state of mind&mdash;perhaps a prick of a sword
might enlighten you?  Speak!'
</p>

<p>
'I am one of your garrison of Phalsbourg,' I replied, with
confidence, assured that to falter now, would destroy me.
</p>

<p>
'Does any one know this man?' asked Schreckhorn, looking
around him; but not one of all the soldiers who crowded
near, responded to his question.
</p>

<p>
'The Count de Bitche knows me well, and will answer for
my honour and courage,' said I.
</p>

<p>
'We have only your word for that; but does it look like
either honour or courage to skulk under this pile of leaves
during an action?  You say you are one of our soldiers?'
</p>

<p>
'But I am <i>not</i> one of your soldiers.'
</p>

<p>
'What then?'
</p>

<p>
'A simple volunteer.'
</p>

<p>
'I do not recognise you.'
</p>

<p>
'How should you, M. Schreckhorn, when you came to
Phalsbourg but yesterday or the day before?'
</p>

<p>
'Peste! that is true; but then you cannot have any
objection to return with us.'
</p>

<p>
'I have a most decided objection, M. le Capitaine.'
</p>

<p>
'Parbleu!'
</p>

<p>
'I do not choose to serve longer under the Count de
Bitche.'
</p>

<p>
'This is rank mutiny; but perhaps you would prefer to
serve under the enemy?'
</p>

<p>
'I have not said so.  A volunteer chooses his own leader;
it is the rule of war.'
</p>

<p>
'From whence came you last?'
</p>

<p>
'Champagne.'
</p>

<p>
'Aha&mdash;France!' said Schreckhorn, with kindling eyes, and
I found that I had made a false move.  'You issued out with
us; speak quick, fellow, for our troops are marching in, and
yonder ten troopers are nearer than I like.  You joined our
sortie?'
</p>

<p>
'My presence here implies that I did so,' said I, haughtily,
and gathering confidence on perceiving that some five or six
petardiers, who remained by the side of Schreckhorn, all the
soldiers of the sortie, were now marching into Phalsbourg.
</p>

<p>
'Then you must know the password for the day?'
</p>

<p>
'I know both parole and countersign.'
</p>

<p>
'What are they?' he asked, in a gentler tone.
</p>

<p>
'"Mathias" and "Vienna."'
</p>

<p>
'False, by St. Nicholas!  Here is a spy!' exclaimed
Schreckhorn, seizing me.
</p>

<p>
'These words were given to me by the Count in person.'
</p>

<p>
'Thou liest!  The Count has not been seen among us to-day.'
</p>

<p>
'And the passwords&mdash;&mdash;'
</p>

<p>
'Are "<i>Gallas</i>" and "<i>Prague</i>."'
</p>

<p>
'Then the villain has deceived me,' said I, as the petardiers
laid hold of me; and just at that moment a soldier came running
breathlessly towards us, crying, as the devil would
have it&mdash;
</p>

<p>
'Hola, M. Schreckhorn! hola?
</p>

<p>
'What is the matter, fellow?'
</p>

<p>
'The spy we took last night has escaped from the turret,
leaving in his place M. le Commandant, robbed and half
murdered.'
</p>

<p>
'Mordieu! then this is our man.  I must have been blind
or mad not to recognise him even in this tatterdemalion dress,
and with that visage of his, so artfully blackened!'
</p>

<p>
'Shoot him!' cried a petardier, drawing a pistolette from
his girdle.  'Tête Dieu! an ounce of lead, my boy, will
pay your passage to the other world, and here it is.'
</p>

<p>
'Cut him down!' suggested another, drawing his sword.
</p>

<p>
'Nay, take him back, and let M. le Comte deal with him,
in person,' said the messenger.
</p>

<p>
'No, no,' added a fourth; 'diable! don't trouble us with
prisoners, M. Schreckhorn; they do nothing but eat up the
rations.'
</p>

<p>
They proceeded, however, to drag me towards the tower of
Phalsbourg, and then I shuddered when contemplating all I
might suffer there, and at the idea of confronting De Bitche
when flushed by pain and vengeance.  But aware that to
resist seven well-armed men would be an act of folly, I could
only glance hopelessly at the horsemen, who were now
galloping along the valley, obviously with a view to cut off
Schreckhorn and his six stragglers.
</p>

<p>
'Here come those ten cavaliers of the enemy's horse,' said
a petardier; 'and this fellow grows heavier at every step.'
</p>

<p>
'Unless we shoot him and run, we shall be cut off, M. le
Capitaine,' urged a second.
</p>

<p>
'And they are Gardes Ecossais, by all that is infernal!'
</p>

<p>
'These fellows will follow us up to the very gate of
Phalsbourg,' said Schreckhorn.
</p>

<p>
'Bah!  I have a petard at the foot of yonder tree, M. le
Capitaine,' said the first speaker; 'let us tie our moucharde
to it, fire the match, and leave him to his friends, who may
pick up his pieces at leisure.'
</p>

<p>
'A brilliant idea, comrade!' growled Schreckhorn, whose
eyes flashed with rage and excitement at the unexpected
danger in which his parley with me had placed him, though
his native love of bloodshed, cruelty, and novelty were tickled
by the barbarous proposition of the petardier, whose words
were acted upon in a moment.  'Sang Dieu! quick, quick;
your straps and the petard; we have not a moment to lose;
these fellows will be on us!'
</p>

<p>
I had scarcely time for breath or thought before my hands
and feet were secured by straps, while the petard was bound
to my breast; and now, lest the reader may not know what
this warlike invention is, I shall describe it briefly.
</p>

<p>
A petard is made of gun-metal, screwed upon a board two
feet square, and holds usually about fifteen pounds of powder;
a vent is screwed into the hole, by which the iron case is
filled.  When fired, its explosion will blow to shreds the
strongest gates and palisades.  The French Huguenots were
the first who invented them, and by their means captured the
city of Cahors in 1579.
</p>

<p>
A pistol was snapped, and the slow-match lighted, and then,
with a brutal laugh, M. Schreckhorn and his soldiers rushed
own the hill towards Phalsbourg, looking back ever and anon
watch the expected explosion.
</p>

<p>
Though hardened by war, and familiarised to its dangers,
this petard&mdash;this frightful engine of death&mdash;pressing like a
charged bomb upon my breast, filled me with a horror too
great for description, for realisation, or for utterance, and
existence became a stupor!  I was unable to move&mdash;to cry
out&mdash;to breathe!  I felt nothing&mdash;saw nothing!  I knew
nothing! all my thoughts and feelings, if I possessed them,
were absorbed in one overwhelming sense of panic!  I was
surrounded by a black and wavering chaos, amid which I saw
a brilliant and luminous spark, close to my face, consuming,
shrinking, and expanding; this was the touchpaper,
communicating with the petard to which I was tied.
</p>

<p>
Suddenly the sense of danger and immediate death became
to great for my whole nervous system.  Bound as I was,
powerless, paralysed, like one amid a crushing nightmare, a
cry at last escaped me!  Then, though fettered neck, hand,
and heel, I rose to my feet, and in a wild endeavour to free
myself from the dreadful engine of destruction to which I was
bound, rolled over the cliff, and fell headlong through the
air&mdash;down&mdash;down&mdash;I knew not how far!
</p>

<p>
There was a cold splash&mdash;a shock&mdash;as I cleft the waters of
a river; then there was darkness, and a rushing, bubbling
sound, as they closed over me; then came blinding light, as I
rose again to the surface; darkness again, and a whirling of
all the senses, as I sank the second time; and with that
sinking a deep, deep sleep seemed to come upon me, and I
remembered no more.

<h3>
CHAPTER LX.
<br /><br />
RESCUE.
</h3>

<p>
A dull and pricking pain over all my stiffened limbs, as the
blood slowly and laboriously forced its way through vein and
artery; a dim light in my aching eyes, as if the dawn were
just stealing upon the night; a confused sense of sounds and
voices growing more distinct and palpable, were the first
sensations of returning animation I experienced.
</p>

<p>
I respired with difficulty, and with that respiration life and
energy came back to me.  I found myself stretched at length
upon a grassy bank, on which the warm sunshine played.  My
arms were free; the straps that bound them once lay beside
me cut and severed, with the unexploded petard&mdash;unexploded
because it had been drenched in the water of the mountain
stream, from which I had been rescued with difficulty by my
friends; but chiefly by the bravery and exertions of the valiant
border baronet, Sir Quentin Home of Redden, and and the
Chevalier Livingstone d'Angoulême, who plunged their
chargers in below that part of the stream in which I was
struggling, and succeeded in getting me landed, as the former
said, 'Like a huge salmon grilse from the Tweed.'
</p>

<p>
I found myself surrounded by the familiar faces of nine
cuirassiers of the Scottish Guard, led by old Patrick Gordon;
and their surprise to find that the rescued man, the escaped
prisoner, whom they had just fished from the river, was one of
themselves&mdash;Arthur Blane&mdash;was great indeed.  Revived by a
good dose of brandy from Patrick's flask, and by some dry
garments which they gave me from their valises (for these
cavaliers were all cap-a-pie, and in marching order), I looked
up to the crag over which I had rolled in my terror and
agony of soul; and on seeing that it was at least fifty feet
high, and that I was safe and sound, wind and limb, and save
a tremulous sensation, not a whit the worse of the whole affair,
I thanked heaven for my release from Phalsbourg, and for my
escape from all the perils that followed it.
</p>

<p>
Mounted on Livingstone's horse, being as yet unable to
walk, unless slowly and laboriously, we proceeded down the
valley, and on looking back, from time to time, I saw the dark
tower of Phalsbourg apparently rise higher among the
mountains, as we descended.
</p>

<p>
'We will return anon, Arthur,' said our grim Marechal de
Logis, 'and bring to a severe reckoning this Count de Bitche
and his garrison of outlaws: I suppose they are all
ragamuffins sprung from the barricades, as we say in Paris.'
</p>

<p>
'And how about your siege of Zaberne?' I asked, surprised
to find myself conversing calmly, and among friends too, after
all that had passed.
</p>

<p>
A cloud came over all their faces at the question.
</p>

<p>
'It fell this morning,' said Gordon.
</p>

<p>
'And Hepburn&mdash;'
</p>

<p>
'Alas! he fell with it.  A shot killed him yesterday; but
his death filled the troops with fury, so we carried the place by
assault this morning.  The King of France has lost a faithful
soldier, and old Scotland a gallant son.  Rest him, heaven!'
said Gordon, looking upward, with tears in his eyes; 'for
there, in his bloody harness at Zaberne, lies cold and still
a heart that never knew fear!'
</p>

<p>
'But the fear of God?' added Livingstone.
</p>

<p>
'Right, chevalier; Hepburn was pious as he was brave.
He was the first soldier in Christendom, and we may never
see his like again.'
</p>

<p>
Hepburn's fall shocked and grieved me, the more that he
had died before I could announce to him that Louis XIII. had
raised him to that rank so coveted by every chevalier in his
army&mdash;marechal of France; and conversing of his worth and
bravery, rather than of my more recent adventures, which
lay, perhaps, nearer my heart, we rode sadly and thoughtfully
towards Zaberne.
</p>

<p>
I found the town breached and battered by cannon-shot;
the houses riddled, the streets in ruin; encumbered by fallen
masonry and unburied bodies.  The soldiers were sullen and
full of fury, especially the Scottish regiments, for the fall of
their beloved commander, who was solemnly interred in the
cathedral of Toul, where a magnificent monument was erected
to his memory.*
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p class="footnote">
* Demolished by the revolutionists in 1793, his tomb was restored by
order of the Emperor Napoleon III. in 1851, as a letter from the curé
of the cathedral informed the author.&mdash;See Note at end.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
We buried the other dead in one huge grave&mdash;friend and
foe&mdash;and threw in their weapons with them.  Still enough
they lay in that ghastly trench, as we heaped the earth over
them; though their uniforms were on and their weapons at
hand, the strife of their gallant hearts was over; but if ever
men went to heaven, they will be the brave fellows who died
with Hepburn at Zaberne.

<h3>
CHAPTER LXI.
<br /><br />
ISABEL DOUGLAS.
</h3>

<p>
The brave general of the Scots being thus slain by those
citizens of Zaberne, who, as Cardinal de la Valette said, 'had
been keeping him at bay for the last six months by playing at
soldiers,' the colonelcy of his celebrated Scottish regiment
devolved upon his cousin, the Laird of Waughton, and the
command of the army upon the Duke of Saxe-Weimar.
</p>

<p>
Under the Marquis of Gordon, the cuirassiers of the Garde
du Corps Ecossais continued to serve in Alsace, with the
combined army of French, Scots, Swedes, and Germans in the
pay of Louis XIII, during the year 1637, and in that time,
though we fought no general action, we were severely engaged
in many skirmishes and minor affairs.  This army, which
occupied Alsace, was ably led by the Duke, who had suffered
many family injuries from the house of Austria, and fearfully
he avenged them in those wars, which devastated the land with
such severity, that the brave old Duke of Lorraine and his
fiery son, deprived of all but their swords and honour, were
ere long reduced to mere private gentlemen, fighting for
bread in the Imperial ranks, while the people of their duchy
and of Alsace, were reduced to such misery, that, in this year
1637, after the capture of Brissac, the governor was compelled
(as the French 'Mercury' records) to place guards upon the
burial-places, to prevent the inhabitants, who were mad with
hunger, tearing the dead from their graves and devouring
them.
</p>

<p>
Two days after the fall of Zaberne, De Bitche blew up the
tower of Phalsbourg, and crossed the Rhine, retiring into the
duchy of Baden.
</p>

<p>
During my absence, the chevaliers of the Scottish Guard
had suffered severely; their number was considerably below a
hundred now, and I missed many a stalwart form and familiar
face from their ranks.  Among those who were absent was
Adam Scott, the hardy young Laird of Tushielaw, who
usually rode on my left hand.
</p>

<p>
One night, several of us sat smoking and drinking in the
garden of a little country-house of which we had taken
possession, and there we were making merry talking of all the
beautiful and amiable sinners of Paris, such as Ninon de
l'Enclos, Marion de l'Orme, the Duchess de Bouillon, Mademoiselle
de Chevreuse, and others; of that right royal glutton,
Anne of Austria, who, in her anxiety still to please her lovers,
had discovered the drugs by which Diana of Poictiers
preserved her beauty in extreme old age; a secret written by a
sorcerer on the skin of a dead-born child, and long borne
about the person of Catherine de Medici.  I heard, too, that
Clara d'Amboise, my voluptuous, intellectual, and political
beauty, still reigned in the heart of Louis, with other gossip
of equal interest to Parisian absentees.
</p>

<p>
During a pause in the conversation, I inquired about my
comrade Tushielaw.
</p>

<p>
'Adam became sick of these fruitless and bootless wars, and
went home to old Scotland,' said Patrick Gordon, gloomily;
for, on finding that a shower of brevets had come from Paris,
and that his name was not among them, our old comrade had
of late betaken himself to the soldier's consolation of grumbling;
'and ere long, Blane, I shall go home too, for I am now
seventy years old at least.'
</p>

<p>
'Seventy!  How, Marechal de Logis, I deemed you but
fifty?' said Dundrennan.
</p>

<p>
'True; but I have served for twenty years in Denmark,
Muscovy, and Brandenburg, and reckon these as forty; yet I
am only a poor Marechal de Logis of horse, while such boys
as those painted fops De Toneins and Turenne, are
camp-masters and knights of all the king's orders.  However, my
Lord Dundrennan, we have an auld Scottish proverb, which
saith <i>a hauf egg is better than a toom doup</i>, so I must e'en
content me.  When we campaigned ten years ago in Westphalia,
a place where, as their own proverb says, you are sure
to find bad quarters, worse rations, and long miles, I often
heard the 'half egg' quoted by one who is now dead and
gone&mdash;poor Hepburn&mdash;than whom no better soldier ever
belted him with steel.'
</p>

<p>
This compliment to our dead leader was received by all
with a silent bow of assent.
</p>

<p>
'But Tushielaw was a wise man, and hath gone home four
months ago to his old tower on the Border side,' resumed
Gordon; 'I would that I had some such neuk to hang my
sword in when I grow too old to carry it.'
</p>

<p>
'Tushielaw,' said Dundrennan, 'was a brave and wild
spirit.  The last May-day we were in Paris, how merrily he,
De Toneins, the Chevalier, and I danced with the grisettes
round a Maypole cut from the Bois de Boulogne, and planted
just outside the Porte St. Antoine.  He was severely wounded
in that affair we had at Mannheim&mdash;'
</p>

<p>
'Ah&mdash;you fought that while I was cooling my heels in the
Bastille.'
</p>

<p>
'We were campaigning among the mountains of the
Bergstrasse.  It was in the month of December; the country
was covered with snow, and our infantry were busy under
Hepburn, de la Force, and de Maille Breze in the fortification
of Heidelberg and Mannheim.  We were now in the land
of brutal barons, beer-bloated philosophers, beggarly
mightinesses, devils, ghosts, and doppelgangers.
</p>

<p>
'Now this town of Mannheim, until we girt it by ramparts,
was nothing more than a pretty village, guarded by the old
castle of Rheinhausen; and our proceedings there, in stone
and lime, were so highly resented by the Imperialists, that
they never left us an hour in peace.  Our boots were never
off, and we slept in our frozen tents, with belts and harness
on, till we were weary of our lives, and furious at the foe.
</p>

<p>
'One evening, when the sun was setting behind the
mountains, and when the ice lay deep and strong upon the
waters of the frozen Rhine and Neckar, a party of Austrian
horse, led by young Count Pappenheim, with furred roquelaures
over their black iron trappings, came suddenly upon
our quarters, and gave us an <i>alerte</i>.  On the right flank
which, as you know, is always our post, the Marquis of
Gordon ordered the trumpets to sound 'to horse;' and after
some smart piqueering with our pistols, we fell on with our
rapiers, at full gallop, and routed three hundred of Goetz's
dragoons, driving them across the valley of the Rhine in full
and disastrous flight.
</p>

<p>
'Brave Tushielaw, being better mounted than any of us,
and being used of old to border-pricking by Ettrick wood and
Solway sands, led the van of this pursuit, till a few of the
Imperialists turned upon him.  Nothing daunted, he
encountered them all.  In three minutes he had slain, or at
least unhorsed, four; but a fifth proved a very evil-disposed
fellow, who, with peculiar vindictiveness, ran him fairly
through the body, and laid him at his horse's heels, bleeding
on the snow which whitened all the mountain-side.
</p>

<p>
'We stripped the warm furs off the dead dragoons, and
carefully rolling up Tushielaw, brought him back with us
to the camp, when the physician of the Marquis declared
him unfit for the king's service; and so, after lingering
among us for a month or two, he went home to Tushielaw to
breathe once more of the breeze that comes down the heathery
glen from those green hills that look on lovely Yarrow&mdash;home,
where many a Scottish exile, now far away, would gladly
be&mdash;home to his old tower, so famed in song and story, that
stands in the solitude where Rankleburn joins the Ettrick.'
</p>

<p>
'So we shall see him no more?' said I.
</p>

<p>
'Not in France, at least: but his story is not yet told,'
continued the Viscount.  'Poor Adam had been outlawed,
and driven from Scotland mainly by the exertions and influence
of William Douglas, Earl of March, who had conceived a
hatred for him, and whose eldest daughter Isabel he had
ventured to love; for he had frequently met her in Peebles at
the play, where the football, the golf, the shooting for the
silver arrow, and all our old Scottish manly games, yearly
attract the flower of the Borderside.
</p>

<p>
'They had exchanged rings and locks of hair, and broken a
piece of money between them, in the old superstitious fashion
at Allhallowmass; but the ring given to Isabel was ominously
inscribed,&mdash;
</p>

<p class="poem">
  '<i>The eye finds;<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The heart chooseth;<br />
  The hand binds;<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But death looseth.</i>'<br />
</p>

<p class="noindent">
And these foreboding words were ever before her, on her lips
and in her heart.
</p>

<p>
'Isabel Douglas had the black, sparkling eyes and dark
eyebrows of her race; but her skin was fair, and her tresses
were like golden-coloured silk.'
</p>

<p>
'<i>Were</i>, say you?'
</p>

<p>
'Listen.  She was more than lovely, for I, who have seen
her, know all this: and know that she possessed the <i>thirty</i>
points of feminine beauty which Brantome declares we shall
never meet with in one woman.  But though she had the dark
Douglas' eyes and their black brows, she was feeble, gentle,
and timid in spirit: so her father, knowing the daring and
pride of Tushielaw, shut her up in his strong castle of
Neidpath.  There she was beyond the reach of the moss-trooping
Scotts, whose hero, Adam, became involved in some vile
border brawl or plot against the government; and with the
servile Lords of Council at Edinburgh, when a personage
styling himself William Earl of March, Lord Douglas of
Neidpath, Lyne, and Manorheid, opposed himself to simple
Adam Scott, of Tushielaw, proscription and banishment were
sure to follow; so our Border chieftain sailed to France, and
took service in our Scottish Guard.
</p>

<p>
'In his absence I need scarcely relate to you how Isabel
Douglas, still shut up in the gloomy tower of Neidpath,
pined; how the brilliance of her beauty faded; how her eyes
lost their lustre, and her lips their enchanting bloom; and
how she repeated, ever and anon, the ominous legend inscribed
on her betrothal ring.  No amusement roused her from the
apathy and consumption into which she seemed to be fast
hurrying.  My lord of March, when he beheld Isabel, on his
return from a year's absence in London, was pleased to be
mightily shocked and repentant.  He removed her to his
livelier mansion in the busy little burgh of Peebles, and
endeavoured, but in vain, to lead her from her own thoughts
and the secret sorrow that preyed upon her; till, finding that
every means failed, he at last consented to bring home
Tushielaw, and wrote to Acheson, the Secretary of State at
Edinburgh, who, by one dash of his pen, restored the estates
of Scott, but failed to cure the worm that preyed upon the
heart of the poor girl whom that year of sorrow in Neidpath
Peel had destroyed.
</p>

<p>
'"He will never return to me, father," said she, and showed
the Earl the legend on her ring, while her tears fell fast, for
she had long been confined to bed, and was so weak and
feeble that the heart of the old Earl was wrung on beholding
the mischief he had wrought.  At last there came tidings
that Tushielaw had sailed from France, that he had landed in
Scotland, and the day on which he was to pass through Peebles
on his way to the forest was known.
</p>

<p>
'On that day there was an unusual bustle and commotion
visible in and about the old castellated mansion of the Earl of
March, which is sufficiently remarkable in the town by its
curious turret that overhangs the street.
</p>

<p>
'At an early hour of the morning, poor Lady Isabel caused
herself to be dressed and conveyed into a stone balcony, that
projected in front of the house; and there, on a couch, she sat
for hours, with her wan face, her black and now ghastly
eyes fixed upon the vista of the sunlit thoroughfare, that she
might be the first to see her lover as he rode up.  At that
time the town was lonely and dull; few noises woke the
echoes of its streets; but so much had disease, anxiety, and
love sharpened and rendered unnaturally acute the senses
of this feeble girl, that she was able to detect the steps of her
lover's horse at an incredible distance, and long before any
such sound reached the ears of the anxious Earl, or her two
sisters who attended her.
</p>

<p>
'A sudden flush crossed her cheek, her dark eyes sparkled
with somewhat of their former beauty, and clasping the hands
of her youngest sister, she exclaimed&mdash;
</p>

<p>
'"He comes, Jeanie!  I hear his horse; but, oh, it is far
off yet!"  Then, closing her eyes, she almost swooned.  Yet
the Earl and his pale daughters heard nothing, for at that
moment Tushielaw was fully three miles distant, galloping
along the highway that wound by hill and wood, and feeling
his heart expand with anxiety and joy as he saw fair
Teviotdale, with all its pastoral beauties, deepening in the
summer sun.
</p>

<p>
'After landing at Eskmouth from a ship of the States-General,
Tushielaw, still suffering from his wound received at
Mannheim, became suddenly oppressed by one of those gloomy
presentiments of approaching evil, which at times come
unbidden to the Scottish mind, and so mysteriously affect it.
He endeavoured to shake off this solemn oppression, but in
vain.  An uncontrollable conviction of the necessity of
reaching home without delay made him ride fast and furiously;
and thus, without presenting himself at the capital to thank
the servile placeman who had recalled him, he crossed the
Lammermuirs and rode straight towards Peebles, which he
entered about sunset.
</p>

<p>
'A half-stifled exclamation of joy burst from Isabel
Douglas when his tall figure, with cloak and plume, was seen
to ride up the street at a rapid pace towards her father's
house.  Full of his own thoughts, and haunted by that
presentiment of coming sorrow&mdash;all unaware that Isabel was in
the town, or, if he saw her, all unprepared for the sad change
in her appearance, the war-worn cavalier rode rapidly past,
without seeming once to lift his eye to the stone balcony,
where the poor trembling girl cast her hollow eyes and thin,
wan hands towards him in an agony of joy that could never
find utterance in words.
</p>

<p>
'Poor Isabel!  Alas! though his soul was full of her
image, Adam Scott beheld her not, and spurred out of sight
without according a word, a glance, a smile of recognition!
And this was the hour, the time, the meeting to which she
had so long looked forward during the age of separation that
had passed!
</p>

<p>
'Isabel gazed after his retiring figure in silence and
speechless sorrow; and then, crushed by the sudden shock
of his apparent heedlessness, she exclaimed, that in France he
had forgotten her, and murmuring the legend on her ring,
she threw up her white hands wildly towards heaven&mdash;there
was a gush of blood from her lips, and she expired in the
arms of the Earl and her sisters before they could bear her in
from the balcony.
</p>

<p>
'She was interred among her ancestors in the burial vault
of the ducal house of Queensberry, and a plate on her coffin&mdash;a
plate to which her sorrowing lover pressed his lips again
and again&mdash;bore the simple legend&mdash;
</p>

<p class="poem">
  'The eye finds;<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The heart chooseth;<br />
  The hand binds;<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But death looseth!' *<br />
</p>

<p class="noindent">
and since then,' concluded Dundrennan, 'we have heard no
more of our comrade, who, though at home in beautiful
Ettrick forest, would, I doubt not, willingly be with us
to-night; for the tower of Tushielaw, with the brawl of
Rankleburn, and the sough of the old oaks that shade it, must be
but a lonely place wherein to brood over the loss of a heart
we have loved.'

CHAPTER LXII.
<br /><br />
A MIDNIGHT MARCH.
</h3>

<p>
The evil fortune which had attended my comrade in his
love affair affected my own spirit, and for several days after
rejoining the Garde du Corps, I felt sad, lonely, and thoughtful.
I was separated from Marie Louise, and though I could
scarcely despair, what had I to give me hope?  Yet a faint,
a wild, and fantastic hope that did come at times, faded and
grew fainter as day succeeded day.
</p>

<p>
She seemed ever before me, vividly and distinctly as I had
seen her last; for in this girl's manner, in the clear full
expression of her eye and the melody of her voice, there were
an indescribable fascination; while her conversational powers
were so full of unstudied grace, that, I verily believe, no man
could speak with her, without feeling himself insensibly
charmed and lured, he knew not why, to love her.  But of
this enough; lest the reader may suspect me of being less a
soldier than a puling sentimentalist.
</p>

<p>
The recollection of Pappenheim was always sufficient to
kindle my fury.  At times, I had a gloomy desire to fall in
battle; but not before I sent the thick-lipped Austrian lord to
his last account, duly attended, if possible, by his friend De
Bitche, as aide-de-camp; and these amiable desires seemed
unexpectedly to be in a fair way of being gratified; for one
evening the Marquis de Gordon, who had been overnight
with the Duc de Lavalette, rode hurriedly to our quarters, and
as he passed me at the door of my billet, where I was lounging
and enjoying a pipe of tobacco.
</p>

<p>
'Now, Blane,' said he, 'your time for vengeance is at hand!'
</p>

<p>
'How, Marquis?'
</p>

<p>
'Count Pappenheim, with a thousand Walloon horsemen,
all peasants, raised in the province of Luxembourg, is in the
village of Lutzelstein; and I am ordered to take a sufficient
body of cavalry, and, if possible, cut him off.  Attended by a
troop of German and Spanish courtezans, clad in the spoil of
plundered provinces, they have been making merry there for
a week past.'
</p>

<p>
'And the Count de Bitche?'
</p>

<p>
'Is with him.  This fellow who, as Shakespeare says of
Talbot,
</p>

<p class="poem">
  '&mdash;&mdash;&mdash; is so much feared abroad,<br />
  That with his name the mothers still their babes,'<br />
</p>

<p class="noindent">
has now a fair chance of ending his life under the same trees
which saw his abduction of the Countess of Lutzelstein.'
</p>

<p>
'And when do we march?'
</p>

<p>
'To-night.'
</p>

<p>
'Excellent!'
</p>

<p>
'Our cuirassiers lead the way; the dragoons of Brissac,
under the Marquis de Toneins, who has just joined from
Paris, are to follow.'
</p>

<p>
'Bravo!' I exclaimed, as a fiery joy swelled up in my
heart.
</p>

<p>
'At daybreak, we will be upon them; and then let the
Austrian and Lorrainer look well to sword and harness, for
the Garde du Corps Ecossais never ride forth on a bootless
errand!'
</p>

<p>
After supping with Home, Dundrennan, and a few others,
on an omelette, with pickled herrings and saur-kraut, dressed
with hog's-lard, a horrible repast, prepared by my German
landlady, and washed down by a few bottles of Rhenish wine,
we marched on our expedition, leaving Zaberne about midnight.
</p>

<p>
De Brissac's dragoons&mdash;still so called because they had
been raised by the marechal of that name in 1600&mdash;with our
troop of guardsmen, made up about nine hundred swords.
The former were led by the Marquis de Toneins, formerly
camp-master of the regiment de Normandie, who had
succeeded the Duc de Bellegarde, slain before Phalsbourg; and
the Marquis of Gordon commanded the whole.  We left the
town at an easy pace, in light marching order, <i>i.e.</i>,
unencumbered by forage, oats, or valises, but otherwise fully
accoutred with all our arms.
</p>

<p>
The night was unusually serene; the month was August;
and, as I looked back at Zaberne, I felt somewhat influenced
by the beauty of the scenery and the silence of the hour.
Around the city, the Sarre wound between woods of chestnut,
and over it, on a lofty rock, stood a castle of the Bishops of
Strasbourg, in the deep arched windows of which, red lights
that twinkled, showed where Cardinal de Lavalette still held
revel with some of his officers; for that old fortress was his
head-quarters.
</p>

<p>
While leaving the city by its only avenue, a steep and
narrow path, hewn through the solid rock in the olden time,
the French cavalry trumpets&mdash;sharp, shrill, and warlike&mdash;rang
in the clear atmosphere, as they played a stirring
march; while the aspect of the successive sections of
steel-trapped horsemen, as they defiled by threes from the ancient
arch of the town-gate, and dipped into the deep path of
echoing rock, with helmets, swords, and corslets glinting to
the moon&mdash;their bridles and scabbards clanking&mdash;was sufficiently
stirring and picturesque to raise even my sombre spirit
from the thoughts on which it had brooded for some days
past.
</p>

<p>
'There sleep the brave whom no earthly trumpet will ever
rouse again,' said Sir Quentin Home to me, as we passed the
long and gloomy mound which marked where we buried the
dead.
</p>

<p>
'By this time to-morrow many of us may be still and cold,
as they are to-night,' thought I.
</p>

<p>
As we penetrated into the mountains, the music ceased, and
we rode in silence; even conversing in the ranks being
forbidden.
</p>

<p>
The moon shed her clear cold light in a brilliant flood
along the rocky vale.  At the bottom of the latter ran a
torrent towards the Rhine.  It was bordered by groves of
pale-green willow, the branches and tremulous leaves of
which swept up the foam that gleamed on the chafed rocks
and rushing water.  In some places, olive-trees and flowering
osiers mingled with them.  Apart from the dull, monotonous
tramp of nine hundred horse upon the road or sward, the
silence was broken only by the occasional bark of a
shepherd's dog, as its wakeful ear caught the distant sound; or
the ominous bay of a wolf, prowling on the wooded peaks of
the Vosges, and by some strange instinct scenting blood and
slaughter on the midnight breeze already.
</p>

<p>
A ride of some miles brought us to a cascade, the white
foam of which sparkled like a torrent of pearls as it plunged
over the brow of a rock into a chasm.  A single fairy-like
rib of stone, forming an arch high above us, with its span
clearly defined against the moon-lighted sky, gave access over
this cascade to the small, but strong feudal castle of the
Counts of Lutzelstein.  This torrent flowed from a little
lonely lake which bathed its walls, and was fed by the snowy
rills of the Vosges.
</p>

<p>
Under Lieutenant Francis Ruthven, in this castle there
was a garrison composed of eighty Scottish musketeers of
Ramsay's regiment; but all was dark and sombre in tower
and turret as we defiled through the valley below, and rode
on, on our errand of death, unchallenged and unseen.
</p>

<p>
It was now that dark, cold hour which always precedes the
dawn.
</p>

<p>
The Marquis ordered strict silence in the ranks, for we
were about to debouch and form squadrons in the flat and
open valley occupied by the bivouac of Pappenheim's
cavalry.
</p>

<p>
'I have but one thought to-night,' said I to Dundrennan,
whom I had made the confidant of my love affair, and in
whose honour I had perfect reliance.
</p>

<p>
'To-night!  You should rather say this morning.  See,
the moon grows pale already&mdash;and this thought?'
</p>

<p>
'Is to have Pappenheim killed or taken; for in either case
Marie Louise will be freed from his obtrusive attentions.'
</p>

<p>
'If both fail?'
</p>

<p>
'Then I shall get myself killed.'
</p>

<p>
'Zounds! nay,' replied the Viscount; 'were I in your
predicament, I should as soon think of hanging myself (like a
certain Grecian blockhead when rebuked by Pythagoras) as
of throwing away my life in battle.  Life is a precious
commodity, and we never know what a day may bring
forth.'
</p>

<p>
'True,' said I.
</p>

<p>
'And the hand of Mademoiselle de Lorraine, deprived as
her father is of land, fortune, rank, and authority, is no
longer an object of gain to Pappenheim, or to any but such a
Quixote as you.'
</p>

<p>
'But he is not the man to relinquish, without a struggle, a
bride so beautiful and so nobly born.'
</p>

<p>
'We shall see.'
</p>

<p>
The order to form squadron, manoeuvre, executed from
the rear at a rapid trot, cut short further conversation.  De
Brissac's dragoons formed four squadrons of double troops;
we formed <i>one</i>, and were in their front about two hundred
paces.  The country around us seemed open; the moon had
sunk behind the hills.  A grove of trees in the valley before
us, with a red light or two from a watchfire, marked the
locality of the enemy, whose bivouac, disposition, and
arrangements were explained to the Marquis, our leader, by
a burgher of Zaberne, who acted as our guide; and who, as
he had purposely misled us, received his fee, and vanished ere
the fray began; for by this traitor the Counts Pappenheim
and De Bitche had been duly informed of our intended
attack, and had thus formed a counter-plan for cutting the
whole of us off; though we had fully believed that nine
hundred regular French cavalry were fully equal to the task
of dissipating a thousand Walloon militia.
</p>

<h3>
CHAPTER LXIII.
<br /><br />
THE AMBUSH.
</h3>

<p>
Pappenheim had brought up another body of at least a thousand
horse, and placed them in a wood, on the extreme left of
his bivouac, in front of which we found the original foe we
had come to attack, the Walloons mounted and under arms,
as we approached; their dark figures being distinctly defined
against the sky, which was becoming lighter every moment,
day having now begun to dawn.  As we advanced in squadrons
and formed line, they threw forward a body of skirmishers;
we did the same, and there ensued a desultory firing
of pistols and musketoons, by which several lives were lost,
and, as usual in such cavalry encounters, a great quantity of
ammunition was wasted; for when troopers contend against
troopers with fire-arms, not one shot in fifty takes effect.
During this skirmish, which absorbed all our interest, we did
not perceive that another body of horse had defiled from the
wood on our left, and taken up a position between it and the
river Sarre, covering the highway, and completely cutting off
our retreat to Zaberne.  This was a fine body of imperial
cuirassiers formed in line three deep, and led by Pappenheim.
My amiable friend De Bitche commanded that corps of Walloons
which held us in play while this artful and successful
manoeuvre had been executed.  The moment they had taken
up their ground, the Walloons recalled their skirmishers by
sound of trumpet, preparatory to charging our line in double
columns of squadrons, and then we discovered the trap into
which we had fallen.
</p>

<p>
'By heavens!' said Dundrennan; 'this game will cost
some of us our lives.'
</p>

<p>
'Mordieu!' added the Marquis de Toneins, galloping
furiously up to our leader, 'M. le Marquis de Gordon,
Lavalette has been misled; instead of one, we have at least
two thousand here to meet our nine hundred men!'
</p>

<p>
'This comes of having troops commanded by cardinals and
holiday generals,' replied Gordon, bitterly.
</p>

<p>
'Then what remains to be done?'
</p>

<p>
'There is nothing for us, but to retire.'
</p>

<p>
'In what order?' asked De Toneins, impetuously.
</p>

<p>
'Form your dragoons in squadrons again, Marquis; we
will cut a passage through those fellows in our rear, and fall
back on Zaberne.'
</p>

<p>
'A passage?'&mdash;
</p>

<p>
'Of course,' said Gordon, loftily; 'I will open the ball
with the gentlemen of the Scottish Guard.'
</p>

<p>
'So be it then&mdash;Vive le Roi!' cried the young Marquis,
as he gave the order, which was executed at full speed, and
before his dragoons attained their new formation, we were
already riding full at this new enemy.
</p>

<p>
We, the cuirassiers, presented a front of about forty files
only, while the body we were to break through, had its flanks
so far extended, that they could have overlapped twenty times
our number.  In the rear rank, I was Lord Dundrennan's
covering file.  The foe, a black and solid line of dragoons,
after firing from their carbines a volley, by which we lost
several brave gentlemen (for their fire was given by a triple
rank), got gradually into a trot, slinging their fire-arms and
drawing their swords, as they advanced with all their
trumpets sounding.
</p>

<p>
As the speed of our horses increased, so did our spirit fire
up at the emergency and the danger; and with the confidence
we felt, of being equal to anything that men might essay, we
became closer and closer, more firm and compact in our
formation, and more furious in our speed.  A wild enthusiasm
seemed to spread from heart to heart along our little line;
and had even a coward been there, he must have caught a
glow of courage from the glorious spirit around him.
</p>

<p>
'Close up&mdash;touch in&mdash;close up!' cried old Patrick Gordon,
when the hot fire thinned our ranks and, as the old Border
ballad says,&mdash;
</p>

<p class="poem">
  'Closing up on every side,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No slackness there was found;<br />
  Though many a gallant gentleman<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lay gasping on the ground'<br />
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
Those who had the misfortune to fall, or be unhorsed, were
doomed to immediate death; for the rear squadrons of the
Marquis de Toneins trampled everything flat upon the turf.
Goring our horses, riding knee to knee at racing speed, with
our teeth set and our swords uplifted we rushed upon the
Austrians.  The Chevalier Livingstone was shot through the
left thigh, but kept his place till his boot was full of blood;
Patrick Gordon was wounded, and a ball took the plume from
my helmet; but the foe had not time to fire another shot;
for, with a reckless shout we were upon them,&mdash;and the shock
of our meeting was tremendous, forcing many of the chargers
to reel back upon their haunches.
</p>

<p>
'Vive le Roi!  St. Andrew!  St. Andrew!' cried the Marquis
of Gordon; and while we all echoed the battle-cry of the
Garde du Corps Ecossais, we bore the enemy back&mdash;cutting,
hewing, slashing, and throwing horses and men to the earth.
I felt many intended cuts and blows glide off my helmet,
given I knew not by whom; and in the crush, confusion, and
fury of the conflict, I actually forgot all about Pappenheim
for a time, and scarcely knew at whom to strike, but hewed
away at random.  Swords were gleaming and clashing on all
sides of me; and as they were whirled about, drops of blood
were seen to fly through the air.
</p>

<p>
The Marquis of Gordon slew three men in succession;
Dundrennan was unhorsed in the melée, but shot a German
trooper by his girdle-pistol, and mounted his horse, almost in
the time I take to write it.  Our old Marechal de Logis was
hewing away on all sides with his enormous bilbo, keeping
three or four horsemen in play at once, for we had now become
broken, involved among the foe, and, while still spurring
and pressing towards the Zaberne road, were engaged in a
series of desperate personal combats, in which every gentleman
of the Guard had at least two swords opposed to his single
weapon.  Poor Sir Quentin Home, though faint with loss of
blood, had rid himself of two antagonists, when a third passed
a sword fairly through his body.  He uttered a wild cry, and,
grasping the right hand of the Austrian to prevent him
withdrawing the blade, he actually thrust the shell close up to the
wound, and, rising in his stirrups with the last energies of
despair and death, clove his destroyer through helmet and
skull down to the moustache, and then threw his sword into
the air, crying,&mdash;
</p>

<p>
'A Home! a Home!  <i>True to the end!</i>' and fell dead from
his horse, with his foeman above him.  It was the motto of his
house he had cried aloud, and with it closed his life and his name,
for&mdash;rest him, God!&mdash;Sir Quentin was the last of his
race.
</p>

<p>
Just as he sank from sight among the frightful débris of
this brief and rapid conflict, I perceived before me a familiar
face, flushed with excitement, and having a pair of eyes that
glared at me through the ribs of a triple-barred helmet.
This was Wolfgang Count Pappenheim, and we were
somewhat apart from the general melée.  Not a word did we
exchange; but there was a furious blow given, a fortunate
parry made, and then a deadly thrust or two; after which we
paused, surveying each other with the gloomy determination
of two men who were never to part alive.  By one lucky
stroke I cut his reins, which placed him completely at my
mercy, for both his pistols were empty; so, with an oath of
rage, he hurled them at my head.  I then levelled a pistol
full in his face, saying,&mdash;
</p>

<p>
'Yield, Count&mdash;yield, or I kill you!'
</p>

<p>
He smiled disdainfully, and, with a glance full of spite and
fury, proffered his sword by the hilt.  I stretched forth my
hand to receive it, when suddenly the traitor turned the point
upon me, and would have run me through the body had not
the blade been struck up by Raynold Cheyne, who was at my
side.  He then passed his own sword twice through the body
of Pappenheim, who fell forward on his horse's neck, and,
with blood gushing from his mouth, dropped dead beneath
our horse's feet.
</p>

<p>
'Here ends our rivalry!' thought I, as the Garde du Corps
pressed on, and dashed furiously along the Zaberne road,
leaving the Marquis de Toneins and his dragoons to pass
through the deadly gap we had made in the ranks of the
German reitres; but in achieving that service nearly twenty
of my noble comrades left their bodies on the field.
</p>

<p>
Of the hundred Scottish cuirassiers who marched from
Paris, there were now only sixty under the king's standard.
We had escaped the snare prepared for us, and slain Count
Pappenheim; but while De Bitche was left alive, I deemed
the work of that day but half done.
</p>

<p>
'Raynold's sword has done you a good service,' said
Dundrennan, in a low voice, and with a grim smile, as he reloaded
his pistols while we rode together at an easy trot along the
path of rock that led to Zaberne.  'Pappenheim is removed
for ever from your path.'
</p>

<p>
'That matters little, Viscount,' said I, bitterly.  'She is
beautiful and nobly born, and will always find those who will
love her and beg her love.  I would that she were still but
the little soubrette I first knew her!  Pappenheim was brave,
but foully treacherous, as the last act of his life proved amply.
Yet 'tis said this fellow really loved Marie Louise.'
</p>

<p>
'He&mdash;then, if so, and common rumour be believed, he never
loved anything else.'
</p>

<p>
'Save his wine-pot.'
</p>

<p>
'True; but the Count is a German.'
</p>

<p>
I looked back to the mountains, where a silver haze was
rising in the sunshine from the valley, where poor Quentin
Home of Redden with so many of our comrades lay.
</p>

<p>
'Twenty of our brother soldiers have gone this morning to
their last account,' said the Marquis of Gordon, with emotion.
'Alas! how this cursed soil of Alsace soaks up our Scottish
blood!'
</p>

<h3>
CHAPTER LXIV.
<br /><br />
MADAME LA DUCHESSE.
</h3>

<p>
Severe operations in Alsace, which luckily left me little
time for reflection, followed this cavalry affair.  Picardy was
invaded by twenty thousand horse and ten thousand foot, all
Spaniards, led by Piccolomini and Prince Thomas of Savoy.
Hepburn's Scottish corps, now known as the Regiment de
Douglas (their new colonel the Laird of Waughton was
recently killed in Alsace), being commanded by Lord James,
son of the first Marquis of Douglas, was withdrawn from the
army to oppose them, and stopped their career on the banks
of the Somme.  I saw those gallant veterans no more; but
the Scots of Ramsay and Leslie remained with us under the
Duke of Weimar.  The Austrians, led by Count Galias,
broke into Franche Compte, but were driven back by the
Vicomte de Turenne, with the loss of five thousand men;
while De la Force defeated the troops of Colloredo on the
Alsatian side of the Rhine, with the loss of twelve hundred
slain and taken.
</p>

<p>
Moreover, to increase the general confusion and complete
the ruin of Duke Charles of Lorraine, about the close of this
year his friend and patron the Emperor Ferdinand II. died
suddenly; and by an unexpected movement of the troops of
Lavalette, the fine palace at Nanci was retaken, sacked,
stripped, and destroyed; all the court of Duke Charles were
dispersed or taken, and where Marie Louise found shelter,
whether in a German convent near the Rhine, or at Vienna, I
knew not; as in our camp we heard but little of the war in
which we were engaged.
</p>

<p>
I feared at times that she might connect me with the death
of Pappenheim, and conceive a repugnance for me in
consequence.  I shrunk from this idea, and longed to acquaint
her that however great was my enmity to the Count, he did
not&mdash;even on that honourable field&mdash;perish by my hand, but
by the sword of a friend, who had at once avenged me, and
averted a crowning act of treachery.
</p>

<p>
The Duke of Weimar turned all the energies of his
combined force of French, Scots, and Swedes, to drive the
Imperialists from his newly-gifted dukedom of Alsace, and
with this view he invaded all the strong places.  Thus, while
serving with the Garde du Corps, I was at the siege of
Colmar, a large town situated on the western bank of a rapid
stream; there we stormed the breach into which my old
acquaintance M. Schreckhorn and his petardiers fired thrice
a cartouche from a mortar, which each time made a frightful
slaughter among the stormers; as these cartouches are wooden
cases, three inches thick, bound with marline, and hold ten
iron balls of a pound each, with about four hundred musket-balls;
but in spite of all opposition we took the town, which
was afterwards ceded to France by the treaty of Munster in
1648, when its walls were demolished by Louis XIV.
</p>

<p>
We next assailed Hagenau, an imperial city which was
defended by the Prince of Vaudemont.  It is situated in the
lower province, and was frequently the scene of contention,
as it stands near the frontier, and was the seat of the Grand
Bailiff of Alsace.  While skirmishing with Colloredo's
horse in the large forest near it six cuirassiers of the Garde
du Corps were slain.  One of these, Raynold Cheyne of
Dundargle, was killed while rescuing the Chevalier Livingstone
when fighting against great odds.  On the night before
this affair Cheyne dreamed that six soldiers bore him through
a forest on their muskets; and singular to say, after receiving
his mortal wound, six of Ramsay's Scots carried him thus to
the rear, and he expired in their hands.  His dream thus
became prophetic; and we buried him with five others, who
were all gallant Scottish gentlemen, under a large chestnut-tree
near the bank of the Zorna.  The defence of Hagenau was
obstinate, and before surrendering the soldiers made a defence
so resolute, 'that one of them,' says Vaudemont, 'after
expending his bullets, fired all his teeth at the enemy.'
</p>

<p>
The Prince effected his escape; but after plundering the
churches a gold crucifix worth three thousand pounds was sold
by a Scots musketeer to a Jew for a rix-dollar and a bottle of
brandy.
</p>

<p>
Then came the attack on Schlettstadt, a strong place, on
one side protected by deep and swampy morasses, which,
being full of willows and rushes, prevented all access.  The
defence was vigorous and the operations severe.  Night after
night we came back from the trenches to our tents as weary
as if we had been rolling the stone of Sisyphus.  As I seemed
to exist without aim or purpose I was reckless of life, and
exposed myself to so many dangers that my name was in the
mouths of the whole army; and strange to say, though I was
one of the stormers in three assaults, as the columns of the
French 'Mercury' attest, and was honourably mentioned, too,
in the despatches of the Marquis of Gordon, the Dukes of
Weimar and Lavalette, I was never touched by sword or
dagger, pike or bullet.
</p>

<p>
We captured Schlettstadt in the night, by means of a flying
bridge across the morass; old Colonel Ramsay, with eight
hundred of his Scots, led the way; our Marechal de Logis,
Dundrennan, the Chevalier Livingstone d'Angoulême, and
half the cuirassiers of the Guard being mingled with them on
foot.  The Austrians poured such a shower of round shot,
shell, and grape that twice as we came near we were forced to
lie flat on our faces, while the iron hail screamed and hissed
over us to tear up the morass beyond; and as this fire destroyed
our bridge, we had no alternative but to proceed and conquer
or be hacked to pieces.
</p>

<p>
Pressing on with a loud hurrah, while the very air seemed
alive with shot of every kind, rockets, and fire balls, we plunged
into the ditches, placed our echelles against the bastion, and
sword in hand hewed a passage in.  Even after that we had to
fight every inch of the way along narrow streets, full of armed
men, and swept by the fire of field-pieces, levelled over
barricades of fallen houses and torn-up paving stones.  In
this defence a young knight of Malta distinguished himself so
much that our soldiers declared he was visible in twelve places
at once.  But as the Duke de Lavalette said, 'The Scots
fought here like Hectors and the Frenchmen fought like
Scots&mdash;and the place was taken in an hour;' then, like Colmar
and Hagenau, it was garrisoned by troops who were
afterwards blockaded by the Spaniards; but our capture was
ultimately confirmed to France by the treaty of Westphalia.
</p>

<p>
On the day following the fall of Schlettstadt, while passing
through a solitary street which was less encumbered by
dead bodies, exploded bombs, cold shot, and fallen houses
than other thoroughfares of the town, I met several groups of
brawling soldiers, and found an Imperial cavalier, whose
sword-arm had been broken and bound by a scarf, feebly defending
himself with his poniard against five or six drunken Switzers
of Lavalette's corps.  Drawing my sword I drove them aside,
but not until I had given one a slash across the face which
cooled his ardour and alarmed his comrades.  I then gave my
hand to the wounded gentleman, on whose black cuirass I
perceived the gilded cross of Malta, and recognised the hero
of the defence.
</p>

<p>
'I was wounded by your stormers during the assault,
monsieur, and concealed myself in a house, hoping that I
might escape: but was discovered by these Switzers who were
in search of beer and plunder.  As I have now only to
surrender, I yield my sword without shame, since it is given to
one of the Garde du Corps Ecossais.'
</p>

<p>
'I thank you for the compliment, monsieur; but beg of
you to retain your sword, and allow me to have your wound
attended to.'
</p>

<p>
'Do, for pity sake&mdash;the agony I suffer is unspeakable; so
much so that I did not at first recognise you, M. Blane.  Do
you not remember me?'
</p>

<p>
I surveyed him attentively, and said,
</p>

<p>
'We have met in Paris, perhaps?'
</p>

<p>
'Nay, monsieur, have you forgotten the night you spent at
the little chapel of St. Nicolas in the Wood, near Nanci, and
the narrow escape you had from the ambush formed by
Pappenheim and De Bitche?&mdash;Do you remember who visited you
there?'
</p>

<p>
'René, the foster-brother of Marie Louise?'
</p>

<p>
'René, the knight of Malta&mdash;yes&mdash;I am he.'
</p>

<p>
'Pardon me, my kind friend, for amid the confusion of
such scenes as those of yesterday and to-day, together with
your change of costume, and your paleness, it is not surprising
that I did not at first recognise you.  Nanci was sacked?'
</p>

<p>
'And the ducal palace destroyed.'
</p>

<p>
'Where now is duke Charles?'
</p>

<p>
'Alas! we know not.'
</p>

<p>
'Vaudemont?'
</p>

<p>
'A fugitive with the remains of his garrison on the German
side of the Rhine.'
</p>

<p>
'And&mdash;and mademoiselle?
</p>

<p>
'Dear Marie Louise!' exclaimed René, as his fine eyes filled
with passionate enthusiasm, while his cheek grew, if possible,
paler; 'she is now Madame la Duchesse d'Alsace.'
</p>

<p>
It was now my turn to tremble and grow pale.
</p>

<p>
'Pardon me, M. René; but did I hear you aright?'
</p>

<p>
'Yes,' said he, casting down his melancholy eyes; 'she is
now married&mdash;married within a week after Pappenheim, her
betrothed and her abhorrence, was slain.'
</p>

<p>
'Married!' I reiterated in a whisper, for I could scarcely
speak, 'to whom?'
</p>

<p>
'Monseigneur le Duc d'Alsace.'
</p>

<p>
'This duke is but a boy&mdash;a child!'
</p>

<p>
'True.'
</p>

<p>
'But this union is impossible!'
</p>

<p>
'Nothing of that kind is impossible to dukes and princes.'
</p>

<p>
'I do not understand you,' said I, considerably ruffled by a
mixture of anger and agitation which I laboured in vain to
conceal.  'I remember a little boy named Duke of Alsace, who
accompanied Charles IV. in his procession through Nanci.'
</p>

<p>
'With his coronet borne before him by a knight of
Malta&mdash;myself.  Well, that little boy is now the husband of Marie
Louise,' said he, with a sneer on his pale lip.
</p>

<p>
'And this espousal&mdash;' I gasped.
</p>

<p>
'Is valid and true, though Louise is nearly twenty and her
spouse is not yet ten years of age.'
</p>

<p>
'Infamous and absurd!'
</p>

<p>
'Absurd as it is cruel!' added René, with deep emotion;
'but such unions and such measures are justified by the crooked
policy of princes and the stern pressure of war.  This child is
hereditary Duke of Alsace and Lord of the nine Bailiewicks
of Leichtenbourg, Baron of Landau and Lauterbourg, of
Ferette and Aultkirk; consequently to unite him more closely
to the crushed house of Lorraine, duke Charles his guardian&mdash;sharp,
short, and decisive in everything&mdash;arranged, and in three
days executed the hitherto unconceived idea of espousing his
daughter, in all the bloom of beauty and of womanhood, to a
sickly little child.'
</p>

<p>
'And who performed this atrocious ceremony?' I asked,
through my clenched teeth.
</p>

<p>
'The most reverend Father in God, the Lord Bishop of
Strasbourg,' replied René, his dark eyes flashing with irony.
</p>

<p>
'And when did this happen?'
</p>

<p>
'About two months ago.  I stood by the side of Marie
Louise at this sacrifice&mdash;a most cruel and wicked sacrifice it
was!  Yet I would rather see her the bride of this harmless
little boy, than of any living man,' continued René, with an
emotion that too evidently was not caused by the pain of his
wound.  'Yet what is it to me&mdash;this cross is my bride?'
</p>

<p>
'And how did Louise look?'
</p>

<p>
'Oh, lovelier and paler than ever, M. Blane!'
</p>

<p>
'Did she weep?' I asked, sternly.
</p>

<p>
'No&mdash;not a tear fell from her; she was pale as marble; and
when her father&mdash;cold, stern, and proud&mdash;kissed her after the
cruel ceremony, and whispered gaily (for I heard him),
"Mademoiselle, your spouse will grow older, so remember the ancient
rhyme,
</p>

<p class="poem">
  "As your wedding-ring wears,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So will your cares,'<br />
</p>

<p class="noindent">
a sickly smile flitted over her wan face; and her child-husband,
who is attracted by her gentleness, and has for her all the
love of a son for a mother, or of a brother for a pale and kind
sad sister, clung to her robe as he left the altar by her side,
confounded and perplexed by the strange ceremony in which
he had borne a part so prominent; and more pleased evidently
with a handsome falcon given to him by Vaudemont, than the
beautiful bride just given him by God.'
</p>

<p>
'Do not say so!' I exclaimed, passionately.
</p>

<p>
'True&mdash;'tis almost blasphemous&mdash;by duke Charles then.'
</p>

<p>
Here was ample food for thought and sorrow!

<h3>
CHAPTER LXV.
<br /><br />
APPOINTED CAPTAIN OF LUTZELSTEIN.
</h3>

<p>
I bit my lips, and strove to conceal from René the real emotions
that stirred my soul; but had not a sudden giddiness and
dimness of sight, consequent to his wound and loss of blood,
assailed him at that moment, he must have detected it.  I
gave him my arm, and, propped on the other side by his
long rapier, he walked beside me in search of a surgeon.
Chancing to meet the physician of the Marquis de Toneins, I
had his wound skilfully dressed, and he was soon pronounced,
out of all danger.  It was the barbarous custom of those wars,
to exact ransoms from prisoners; so, on finding himself well
enough to walk about next day, René, who lived with me at
the quarters of the Guard, said,
</p>

<p>
'I cannot pay you a ransom, M. Blane, for I possess nothing
in this world but my sword and the cross of my order.'
</p>

<p>
'You are my special prisoner, dear René,' said I; 'but never
had the thought of ransom from you entered my mind.  I shall
obtain your release from Lavalette, with passports wherewith
to cross the Rhine.  You have been the faithful friend
of Marie Louise&mdash;'
</p>

<p>
'All, yes&mdash;ever since the happy days at Nanci, where, as a
boy and girl, we fed the golden fish in the fountains and played
and shot together with the arbalest à jallet in the palace
gardens.'
</p>

<p>
'Well; continue to be her friend: for in such times as these
with a child for her husband, she will have much need of
an ally so faithful as you.'
</p>

<p>
René grew pale and cast down his eyes, while my own
breast heaved responsive to the sigh that escaped him; for the
love of René, like my own, seemed one of the many misplaced
affections that, in spite of reason, will ever exist in the world.
We parted; but as we knew not where Marie Louise was
residing&mdash;whether secluded in her father's conquered dukedom,
or on the German side of the Rhine&mdash;he crossed the latter,
and joined the army of Count Gallas, under whose command,
he, poor fellow! perished soon after at the siege of St. Jean
de Losne.
</p>

<p>
Poor René! in his heart were united the tenderness of a
woman with the faith of a dog and the valour of a lion.
</p>

<p>
I was sad for many days after parting with René, for our
mutual love for Marie Louise, which neither avowed but both
suspected, formed a tie and community of spirit between us.
Yet the tidings he had given me were not calculated to rouse
my spirit or make me happy.  She was indeed lost to me for
ever; and now I had nothing to look forward to but steadily
dedicating myself to the desperate profession of a soldier of
fortune.  At times a burst of anger and anxiety seized
me&mdash;anger at the facility which made her yield to a union so
absurd, and anxiety lest this mere child D'Alsace might grow
up a very Pappenheim in temper and morality; one who
might lead a wife, ten years his senior, a life of anything but
happiness and peace.  Amid such speculations as these,
Patrick Gordon, the Marechal de Logis, found me one
evening, and summoned me to the presence of the Marquis de
Gordon, who occupied the house of the Bailiff of Schlettstadt,
a comfortable mansion, which he shared with Dundrennan and
some others of the Guard.
</p>

<p>
I found him seated at table, with several letters and a good
bottle of Rhenish before him.
</p>

<p>
'Blane,' said he, 'I have the happiness to acquaint you
that I have here letters from his Eminence Cardinal Richelieu,
and from Sir Archibald Acheson of Glencairn, the Secretary
of State in Scotland, announcing that your patrimonial estate
of Blanerne is restored to you, together with the Bailerie of
Tungland Abbey, and the Captainry of Carlaverock as
possessed by your father Sir Arthur, and that now you are free
to return and hang your sword under the roof where you first
saw the light; but where I may warn you it will not hang
long; for a day is coming&mdash;and coming fast, too&mdash;when Scotland
will need all her sons and all their swords to defend her.'
</p>

<p>
'When that day comes, Marquis, I shall not fail her,' said I.
</p>

<p>
'Nor I,' added our white-headed Marechal de Logis, with
a kindling eye.
</p>

<p>
'I give you my warmest thanks, dear Marquis, for these
most welcome tidings.'
</p>

<p>
'What, of a probable war at home?'
</p>

<p>
'No; of the reversal of that most unjust and cruel act of
proscription which was passed against me.  So Madame la
Comtesse d'Amboise did not forget me?'
</p>

<p>
'My dear fellow,' said the Marquis, laughing, 'Clara
never forgets a lover so near the Rhine, and so far from the
Bastille, if I may say so.'
</p>

<p>
'Marquis, I swear to you&mdash;&mdash;'
</p>

<p>
'Do not swear, my friend,' continued the gay Gordon,
'for I will not even then believe you.  The deuce! no
woman would make such a fuss with a handsome young fellow
as she did with you, and give him a Spanish barb worth six
hundred crowns of the sun, without feeling something more
than mere friendship for him.  But I have nothing to do with
all this.  You are now free, Blane&mdash;free to leave the old
Garde du Corps Ecossais of a thousand gallant memories&mdash;free
to go home to Scotland, our dear fatherland, if you will.'
</p>

<p>
'Ah, Marquis, at present I have little desire to leave them
and these exciting scenes, even for the pastoral home where
my gallant father and his forefathers sleep.'
</p>

<p>
'How!  You have another love affair in hand.  (A blush
and a sigh.)  I am right, then.  The devil, Blane! you are
very lucky to have all these pretty amusements at this
distance from the Louvre.  But as a bribe to detain you
among us&mdash;&mdash;'
</p>

<p>
'My Lord Marquis, believe me, I require no bribe.'
</p>

<p>
'I have obtained for you from the Cardinal Duke de
Lavalette the captaincy of Lutzelstein; you remember that old
tower which commands an important defile of the Vosges, two
or three leagues from Phalsbourg; and if you accept&mdash;&mdash;'
</p>

<p>
'Accept, Marquis!  I do so with gratitude; and if the
enemy pass that way, Lavalette will find that his confidence
has not been misplaced.'
</p>

<p>
'Good.  An escort of thirty of the dragoons De Brissac
will be given to you, and you will have to depart this very
evening to assume this new command.'
</p>

<p>
'I shall be ready in an hour.'
</p>

<p>
'Adieu, then, till we meet again.'
</p>

<p>
'Farewell, my lord.'
</p>

<p>
And we parted.  I left this brilliant, high-born, and
high-spirited noble, little weening that I was never again to
see either him, or my brave comrades of the Garde du Corps
Ecossais!
</p>

<p><br /><br /><br /></p>

<p><a id="chap66"></a></p>

<h3>
CHAPTER LXVI.
<br /><br />
THE CASTLE OF LUTZELSTEIN.
</h3>

<p>
With a mind full of chequered thoughts, I set out that
evening for the scene of my new duties, duly furnished with
all the papers given to me by the Marquis, and escorted by a
party of Brissac's dragoons.  I left Schlettstadt behind, and
took the way towards the wooded Vosges.
</p>

<p>
I thought of Marie Louise, and of all that fate and fortune
had so studiously, sternly, and unremittingly raised between
us as barriers, after all the kindness, love, and adventure we
had shared together; and I vainly strove to dismiss her from
my mind with a prayer that she might be happy.
</p>

<p>
Then I thought of my home and the letters just received
from Scotland&mdash;letters by which I was free to return whenever
I wearied of war, and the service of king Louis.  Then
came a glow of honest pride for the trust reposed in me, by
this appointment to command a fortress, however small, and I
resolved to fulfil that trust to the utmost.
</p>

<p>
Alas, for the vanity of human resolves!  How I obeyed
king Louis, and how I fulfilled the trust of Lavalette, the
sequel will show.
</p>

<p>
Lastly, I began to feel lonely in the new separation from
the frank military spirits of the Guard, with whom, as brother
Scotsmen (that endearing term) I had spent so many happy
days, and with whom I had so many kindly associations and
sympathies in common.  I recalled those gallant men, whose
manly forms were now mouldering in a soldier's grave&mdash;Sir
Quentin Home of Ravendean, Raynold Cheyne of Dundargle,
Sir Archibald of Heriotmuir, and Bruce of Blairhall, and
pondered sadly on who might next be missing from the ranks,
when again I saw the Garde du Corps: and so, full of thought,
I rode on, increasing by every step the distance between my
countrymen and me.  With no sound near but the monotonous
tramp of my French escort, we advanced towards the mountains
of the Vosges, the darkness deepening, and the night
casting its shadows over us.
</p>

<p>
The distance we had to ride, was, if I remember, only
about twelve leagues; but we were all ignorant of the
country, and by unnecessary detours, added to our journey.
</p>

<p>
We soon passed through Andiau, a little town upon the
margin of a stream which is so named, and which rolls from
the Vosges laden with the spoil of the forest.  The ancient
castle of the Barons of Andiau, who held the town as a fief
from the abbess of a convent there, was, like the convent
itself, garrisoned by a portion of our troops; though this
pious establishment was founded only for dames who could
show their sixteen quarters of nobility, their abbess having
the title of princess of the empire, with a seat among the
Rhenish prelates, old Sir Andrew Gray of Broxmouth,
colonel of Swedish infantry, had now quartered himself and
his staff among them, and, seated in the chair of the reverend
mother, drank her wine, collected her rents, and made
himself quite at home.
</p>

<p>
A ten miles' ride took us through Bar, in a district clothed
with vineyards, and literally flowing with milk and honey; and
next we came to Maltzheim, a town of the Bishops of Strasbourg,
at the foot of the Vosges, ruined in after years by the
Imperialists.  Spurring on silently and rapidly, by the pale,
chill light of the waning moon, I saw the tall grim tower of
Phalsbourg, with all its memories so exciting to me, rising on
its rock; but like other strong places, it was now garrisoned
by the soldiers of Louis XIII.  I could see the turret wherein
I had that deadly struggle with De Bitche; I could see the
arched gate, from which, with a desperate heart, I issued with
the Austrian sortie; the place where I had concealed myself
and where the arquebussiers fired over me; the dreadful spot
where Schreckhorn bound me to the petard, and the cliff over
which, in despair, I had flung myself into the river.  At all
these places I gave a dark and furious glance, and turning my
back on them, urged my escort on, and dashed into a steep
and dark defile, which led direct to the castle of the Counts
Palatine of Lutzelstein.
</p>

<p>
We soon reached the tower by a zig-zag ascent, up which
our horses wound with no little difficulty.  The noise of our
approach was concealed by the roar of the cascade which
thundered over a wall of rock into the ravine below; but on our
appearance at the little stone bridge which spanned that tide
of foam, we were immediately challenged by the sentinel; a
drum was beaten within, and the garrison, which was still
composed of a detachment of Ramsay's Scots, commanded by
Lieutenant Ruthven, stood to their arms; and after due
inquiries and explanations, the gates were opened, and about
sunrise, I found myself duly installed Governor of Lutzelstein;
and seated at table in the hall, discussing with Ruthven a
breakfast of hot coffee, with pickled carp from the Rhine,
with ham, eggs, and schnaps.
</p>

<p>
The Lieutenant, Francis Ruthven of the house of Redcastle,
was an active and brave young officer, nephew of the
Marshal Earl of Forth, and in after years colonel in the
Dutch service, and Governor of Monell.  He proved a very
pleasant companion, and seemed glad of my arrival to relieve
the monotony of his command in that lonely castle, among
those wood-covered mountains that form the great barrier
between France and the Empire, and which are usually capped
with snow during half the year.
</p>

<p>
There a month stole tediously away, and save an occasional
alarm, which gave me some anxiety, and beat us up in our
shirts in the night, I had nothing to disturb the somewhat
moody current of my thoughts, and I fear that my companion
the lieutenant must have deemed me a very dull fellow, to be
one of Gordon's cuirassiers.
</p>

<p>
'You have an estate,' said he to me, one day, 'while I have
nought in this world but my sword; yet I am a jollier fellow
than thee&mdash;how is this?'
</p>

<p>
'I know not,' said I, briefly.
</p>

<p>
'I am somewhat of a philosopher,' said he, smoothing his
fine black moustache, 'and at college learned to deem a rich
man in some respects a greater slave than a poor one.'
</p>

<p>
'How?'
</p>

<p>
'Was not Seneca right, when he termed a great wealth a
great servitude?'
</p>

<p>
'Perhaps; yet believe me,' said I, with a smile, 'it is not
the load of wealth that oppresses me.'
</p>

<p>
Lutzelstein was the scene of one of De Bitche's greatest
atrocities&mdash;the abduction of its widowed countess.  It was a
true old German castle, the abode of gloom and superstition;
moreover, it was, I know not how, associated with the memory
of fair Agnes Sorel, the Lady of Beauty, the hapless mistress
of Charles of France; and on the wall of the room I occupied
hung a tapestry said to be worked by her, and which
represented one of those most authentic scenes which enrich
the ancient history of France, to wit&mdash;King Pepin la Bref
laying at the feet of his queen, Bertha the giantess, the head of
a lion, which he had cut off by one blow of his sword, and
with the ears of which a chubby brat, supposed to represent
the future Charlemagne, was playing.

<h3>
CHAPTER LXVII.
<br /><br />
VISCOUNT DUNDRENNAN.
</h3>

<p>
Towards the latter end of October, when the brown or ruddy
autumnal tints were stealing over the chestnut forests of the
Vosges, a day of gloom had closed, and, as the night drew on,
the red lurid light behind the mountains to the westward of
Lutzelstein denoted a coming storm.  There was a solemn
stillness in the valley, and the hoarse brawl of the cascade
beneath the castle-wall rang clearly on the dewy air.  Smoking
a Dutch pipe, I sat on the platform of the keep, immersed in
reverie, and hoping a storm might come on, as a little variety,
when the form of a horseman, far off, galloping along the
defile below, caught my eye; and as every stray passenger
became an object of interest and source of speculation in that
solitary place, I watched him as long as the light made him
visible.  I soon discerned that he was armed, and wore a
helmet, and that he seemed to have come by the road which
led towards the Rhine.  He was well mounted, for he rode
swiftly; yet the light faded away, and the moon had risen,
amid black and flitting clouds, which afforded momentary
gleams of witchlike light, before he halted at the gate of
Lutzelstein, and with a Scottish tongue replied to the
challenge of the Scottish sentinel.  Ruthven summoned me from
the usual scene of my meditations, and on descending to the
arched hall, wherein ten huge candles in sconces of tin flared
like torches in the wind, I saw a tall and handsome cavalier,
completely armed in the trappings of the Guard.  He was
Dundrennan, who turned and embraced me.
</p>

<p>
'Viscount&mdash;you here!' I exclaimed.
</p>

<p>
'Why not?' said he, throwing aside his sword and gloves;
'am I not welcome to this new castle of king Louis?'
</p>

<p>
'But, here without an escort!'
</p>

<p>
'Tush! the whole country is clear of men now, and,
unfortunately, of women too, which I find much more insupportable;
but get me some wine if you have any, for I am sorely
athirst by my long ride.  By Jove! they have capital wine at
Maltzheim, and you are certain to have some of the same stuff
here.'
</p>

<p>
'And you have come from&mdash;&mdash;'
</p>

<p>
'Seltz, twenty-seven miles north of Strasbourg, where we
are blocking up a body of fugitives under De Bitche, and
pouring such a fire of shot and shell upon them, that those
who die there will not deem the lower world quite so hot
as people say.'
</p>

<p>
'And to what do I owe the pleasure of seeing you?'
</p>

<p>
'A despatch for you, M. le Gouverneur, and here it is; but
while you con it over, Ruthven, like a good fellow, will assist
me to get some of my iron shell off, for I have ridden eight
good leagues since I mounted.'
</p>

<p>
I tore open the letter which he gave me, and found it to run
as follows:
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p class="noindent">

<p>
'I have just ascertained that a coach containing certain
Imperialists of high rank is proceeding from the
neighbourhood of Toul, towards the German frontier; and that,
guided by a spy who is in our interest, it will, on the night of
the 11th, pass through a defile of the Vosges, two miles north
of your garrison.  These Imperialists it behoves you to capture,
and as you value the service of the most Christian King,
to seize at all hazards.  They have a slender escort, to avoid
notice; but kill or capture them all, and my good Lord
Dundrennan will return to me for further orders.  Meantime,
accept the assurance of my utmost esteem.

<p><br /></p>

<p>
'Well, Arthur, what is to be done?' asked Dundrennan,
stretching out his legs and draining a long horn of purple
Rhenish, after scanning over the Marquis's letter.
</p>

<p>
'Obey.'
</p>

<p>
'Of course; I never doubted that: so we shall have a little
affair with sword and pistol.'
</p>

<p>
'Who may those Imperialists be?  Duke Charles, perhaps?'
</p>

<p>
'Nay, he is supposed to be with Count Gallas beyond the
Rhine.'
</p>

<p>
'De Bitche probably?'
</p>

<p>
'Wrong again: he is shut up by our troops in Seltz.'
</p>

<p>
'This coach passes on the evening of the 11th.'
</p>

<p>
'To-morrow.'
</p>

<p>
'I will undertake this duty; and you, Dundrennan, will
keep the castle for me in my absence.'
</p>

<p>
The Viscount demurred loudly against this arrangement;
but in case the whole affair might be a decoy, a snare to lure
off my garrison and recapture the castle of the Counts Palatine,
he ultimately agreed to keep the place in my absence, and
secure a retreat for me in case of my falling into an ambush.

<h3>
CHAPTER LXVIII.
<br /><br />
THE SURPRISE.
</h3>

<p>
With ten of Brissac's dragoons, each having a Scottish
musketeer <i>en croupe</i> behind him, I mounted and rode from
Lutzelstein about sunset on the 11th, having previously, since
mid-day, beset the defile by men disguised and armed, to warn
me in case of being anticipated or foiled by an earlier passage
of the expected vehicle.
</p>

<p>
The country around was so solitary that we reached the
valley unseen, and I concealed my men in a wood on each
side of the way, after throwing across it several large trees as
a complete barrier to the coach passing without a desperate
struggle on our part.  The musketeers piled arms, five on
each side of the way; the dragoons unbitted their horses, and,
apart from all, I lay under a thick hazel bush, with my sword
and pistols beside me, watching the far-stretching vista of the
narrow defile, which was gradually growing darker and more
gloomy as the light of the set-sun faded beyond the summits
of the foliaged hills.  I had seldom seen a place more silent
or solemn than that sequestered dell as its shadows deepened
in the night.  It was the scene of our conflict with
Pappenheim; and near me lay a human skull&mdash;a ghastly relic of
that day's conflict; torn perhaps by wolves from the grave
where the dead were buried, and left there to be bleached
upon the soil, in which it was partly sunk.  It was full of
earth, and amid that earth some tiny flowerets bloomed.  This
sad relic of war and mortality imparted an additional gloom
to the scene of our night-watch, and the lines of the Spanish
poet, beginning Bella Flor, on a similar incident, occurred to
me, and may be rendered thus:&mdash;
</p>

<p class="poem">
  'Ah, beauteous flower! where hast thou grown?<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How early is thy blight and bloom!<br />
  Thy scented blossoms scarce are blown,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When destined to this ghastly tomb!<br />
  'Tis hard to pluck thee at thy birth;<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And sad to leave thee in this bed;<br />
  To leave thee in thy native earth,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is but to leave thee with the dead!'<br />
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
Just as the moon, clear, white, and full, began to rise above
a shoulder of the Vosges, one of my scouts came hurrying up
to announce that a coach, escorted by a party of horsemen,
had entered the defile and was approaching.
</p>

<p>
'By horsemen, you say: how many?'
</p>

<p>
'I counted six; three in front and three in rear.'
</p>

<p>
'Armed?'
</p>

<p>
'Doubtless, monsieur.  I saw the butts of their slung
carbines gleam in the moonlight.'
</p>

<p>
'How far are they distant?'
</p>

<p>
'About a mile.'
</p>

<p>
'Bravo, M. le Caporal! get your dragoons on horseback.
Musketeers, unpile arms, and look to your matches; though
I believe the troopers and I will save you all trouble in this
matter.'
</p>

<p>
While the dragoons were bitting their horses and mounting,
and while the musketeers stood to their arms, the moon rose
fully above the mountain ridge, pouring a clear, cold, steady
light into the narrow vale, along which I could see certain
dark and indistinct objects approaching; and as they drew
near, six horsemen became visible, escorting a large coach,
which was drawn by four black horses, and had two valets
behind it.  The horsemen were accoutred with holsters,
swords, and carbines: three appeared to be gentlemen, having
feathers in their hats.  With my sword in one hand, and a
cocked pistol in the other, I dashed forward at the head of my
ten dragoons to bar the passage.
</p>

<p>
'Halt!' I exclaimed: 'halt, and surrender!'
</p>

<p>
'In whose name?' demanded a gentleman, drawing a pistol
from his holster.
</p>

<p>
'In the name of Louis of France and Navarre.'
</p>

<p>
'Perish thou and he together!' replied the other, firing his
pistol full in my face; but, fortunately, I made my horse
plunge, and so disturbed his aim that the ball whizzed
harmlessly past me.  'Forward, messieurs,' he added; 'break
through these marauders!'
</p>

<p>
'Advance,' I exclaimed; 'cut down all who resist.'
</p>

<p>
'France&mdash;France and Navarre!' shouted my troopers, as
they fell on with sword and pistol.
</p>

<p>
I heard the screams of women inside the huge lumbering
coach, which was immediately stopped, for the traces were
cut, the reins wrenched from the hands of the driver, and two
of the horses were shot.  A confused firing of pistols, and
clashing of swords, with a vast display of kicking, spurring,
and hallooing ensued in the moonlight; but in a trice the
carriage was ours; three of the attendants were shot, and six,
including the valets and driver were taken, dismounted,
disarmed, and handed over to the musketeers, who freed the
traces from the dead animals, and immediately put the wheels
once more into motion; but now, in the direction of
Lutzelstein.
</p>

<p>
All this uproar and loss of life ensued, and was over,
almost in the time I have taken to narrate it.
</p>

<p>
The coach was very old-fashioned, being shaped like an
enormous pie-dish, with an elliptical roof, surmounted by a
coronet.  It was so large that it might have passed for a
small cottage on carved and gilded wheels.  It was covered
by heraldic and allegorical devices, stars, clouds, suns, moons,
and elaborate gildings.  It had three large glass windows on
each side.  Perceiving faces at them, and being anxious to
learn who these important persons were, of whose progress
towards the Rhine, Gordon had been apprised so far off as the
trenches at Seltz, and for whose capture the lives of three
human beings had been sacrificed, I cantered forward to one
of the windows, as the enormous conveyance rumbled up the
steep, rocky road, and knocked on the pane with my ungloved
hand, in token of amity.  It was opened, and a female face,
fair as beauty and pale as terror could make it, looked at me
imploringly, with eyes whose blue seemed unnaturally bright
in the moonbeams, which edged with light the thick masses
of her golden hair; and the sentences of apology and inquiry
which I had been framing died away on my lips when I
recognised the soft features, and heard the beloved voice
of&mdash;Marie Louise of Lorraine!

<p><a id="chap69"></a></p>

<h3>
CHAPTER LXIX.
<br /><br />
HUSBAND AND WIFE.
</h3>

<p>
I checked my horse, and stricken to the soul, like one who
had been guilty of a great crime, shrank to the rear of all my
party; nor did I again approach her, till we had surmounted
the ascent to Lutzelstein; till the coach had rumbled over the
castle bridge, and halted in the inner court, where the loud
and hearty voice of Lord Dundrennan in warm congratulation,
recalled me to the task I had to perform.
</p>

<p>
'Blane,' said he, 'zounds! there are women in this huge
tumbril.  Whose better half have you abducted to-night?'
</p>

<p>
'Hush, for heaven's sake, hush! 'tis Louise of Lorraine.'
</p>

<p>
'The Duchess D'Alsace&mdash;where?'
</p>

<p>
Torches were brought, and the doors of the carriage were
opened.  There sprang out a little boy clad in a rich coat of
white satin, laced with gold, his fair hair tied with a blue ribbon.
His air was haughty, but evinced alarm; for the brave child
kept his hand on his tiny dagger.  Then followed an old
priest, in whom I immediately recognised Father Colville of
the Scottish College at Pontamoussin, keeper of St. Lucy's
reliques at St. Michel.  Hat in hand I stood by the steps to
assist Marie Louise; but disdaining my proffered courtesy, she
sprang lightly to the ground.  A young lady, her attendant,
respectfully followed, with a countenance as expressive of
terror, as that of her mistress indicated sorrow and anger.
</p>

<p>
'Messieurs, to what place is this we have been brought?'
she asked.
</p>

<p>
'Lutzelstein, a castle on the Vosges,' I replied.
</p>

<p>
'And you command here?' she asked upbraidingly, as she
bent her beautiful eyes upon me, with an expression which
made my heart tremble.
</p>

<p>
'I do&mdash;but mademoiselle&mdash;'
</p>

<p>
'I am Madame la Duchesse d'Alsace!'
</p>

<p>
'Pardon me&mdash;alas!  I had forgotten it.'
</p>

<p>
'Well, monsieur.'
</p>

<p>
'I wish to explain&mdash;'
</p>

<p>
'What?'
</p>

<p>
'This most unpleasant affair,' I urged.
</p>

<p>
'Is it thus, M. Blane, that you designate a brutal brawl
devised by yourself, for my capture?  Oh Arthur!
Arthur! there was a time when I hoped for better deeds from you.'
</p>

<p>
'Marie Louise, I swear to you&mdash;'
</p>

<p>
'Monsieur!'
</p>

<p>
'Pardon me, and oh madame! do not pierce my heart with
reproaches.  Do not unheard condemn me to a life of sorrow
and regret.  I have acted to-night but in obedience to <i>this
written order</i>, sent by the Marquis of Gordon from the
trenches before Seltz, and delivered by Viscount Dundrennan,
a gentleman of the Garde du Corps Ecossais.'
</p>

<p>
'Well&mdash;we are your prisoners&mdash;my husband and I,' said
she, taking by the hand the child, who shrank close to her
side as if for protection.
</p>

<p>
'So this is the Duke d'Alsace?' said I, regarding the poor
urchin with a glance of a very mingled nature.
</p>

<p>
'<i>My</i> husband, and as such to be respected,' said Marie
Louise, blushing to her white temples, and by hauteur vainly
endeavouring to veil the shame of this absurd avowal, which
was made before so many persons.
</p>

<p>
'You are indeed prisoners,' said I, sadly; 'prisoners whom
I dare not release.'
</p>

<p>
'Very well, M. Blane, enough of this! lead us to our
apartments for to-night&mdash;farewell!'
</p>

<p>
'Adieu, madame,' said I, bowing low, and while my heart
seemed crushed or withered up within me, I gazed after her
figure as it disappeared into the tower, where Lieutenant
Ruthven escorted her and the female attendant to well-secured
apartments, and placed sentinels at the doors and in the
passages.  The other prisoners, who proved to be Duke
Charles's masters of the horse and household, with a
councillor of the chamber of accounts at Nanci, and two valets,
we secured elsewhere in one chamber, where, as they bear no
other part in this narrative, we shall politely bid them adieu.
</p>

<p>
'Come, Blane,' said Dundrennan, proffering to me a huge
cup of wine; 'be a man for the honour of Galloway.
Drain off this&mdash;then away to bed and sleep.  To-morrow you
will awake more placid and composed.'
</p>

<p>
'Sleep!' I reiterated; 'she has a husband, Dundrennan.'
</p>

<p>
'Bah!' replied the wild young Lord; 'in your place, I
would soon teach her to forget that trifling circumstance.'
</p>

<p>
'For shame, my Lord.'
</p>

<p>
'Well, this capture of to-night is most unpleasantly
important.'
</p>

<p>
'How, Viscount?'
</p>

<p>
'I must, in obedience to orders, ride back to Seltz, that the
Duc de Lavalette may be duly informed of it.'
</p>

<p>
'True&mdash;I had forgotten,' said I, biting my nether lip
with anger, that any one, save myself, presumed to have an
interest in the person of Marie Louise; but in about an hour
after this, with four of Brissac's dragoons as an escort,
Dundrennan left me for the French camp to report this seizure,
which was deemed so important, that he was next day
despatched to Paris for the special orders of King Louis
concerning the disposal of my prisoners.
</p>

<p>
Meanwhile let me relate how it fared with us at the
solitary castle of Lutzelstein.
</p>

<p><br /><br /><br /></p>

<p><a id="chap70"></a></p>

<h3>
CHAPTER LXX.
<br /><br />
A CATASTROPHE.
</h3>

<p>
Three days passed over, during which my fair prisoner
remained in her apartments and I saw nothing of her.  The
little Duke, however, I met frequently, playing with the
watchdog in the castle-yard, or with a hawk which was his
favourite companion, and which, from the tower-head, he
plumed and urged to fly at every feathered biped that came in
view.  He seemed a good-humoured, happy little boy, and
handsome withal; but as he never approached me, and I&mdash;for
my own reasons&mdash;cared not to cultivate his acquaintance, we
never spoke, though he saluted me very courteously whenever
we passed.
</p>

<p>
On the fourth day Marie Louise came to the bartizan with
her attendant; and on perceiving that I studiously avoided
her, she promenaded there daily, and consequently I daily
witnessed the little boy-husband toying with her, and hanging
about 'his duchess,' for whom he evinced all the love of a
child for a mother or for an elder sister; for Marie Louise
was an incarnation of all gentleness and sweetness.  Moreover
she was kind and even affectionate to the boy, affecting to
take an interest in his prattle, and in the playthings he
hastened from time to time to show her; and more than once,
when surprising them engaged in a game of romps, or playing
with shuttlecock and battledore on the terrace, I have seen
how Marie Louise grew deadly pale, and withdrew with a
bow of sorrow and confusion.
</p>

<p>
Then I would reflect, that in ten years more this child
would be a youth of twenty, perhaps strong, brave, and
impassioned; and that Louise would still be young and
beautiful.
</p>

<p>
My position became insupportable!  I could not desert my
command, nor retire from it until regularly relieved from
head-quarters; but in a transport of bitterness I wrote to the
Marquis of Gordon and to the Duke de Lavalette, praying
them to appoint another captain of Lutzelstein, and allow me
to rejoin my comrades in the field.  Daily I looked for a reply;
but weeks passed on, the brown autumnal woods were becoming
bare and stripped; but no horseman came from the Rhine&mdash;no
letter from the trenches before Seltz.
</p>

<p>
Marie Louise&mdash;the ignes fatus, the hope of happier days,
the star that had shone before me so long, the sole object of
my thoughts&mdash;was living under my care, under the same roof
with me; but separated from her by the peculiarity of our
relative positions, we might as well have had the wall of
China between us.
</p>

<p>
One day I came somewhat abruptly upon her.  She was
seated thoughtfully on an angle of the terrace or rampart
which surrounded the tower.  Her white cheek rested on her
whiter hand, and her eyes were fixed vacantly upon the foot of
the valley which was traversed by the road that led towards
Zaberne, and through which meandered a tributary of the
Ell, and from its banks a haze was rising in the sunshine
through the leafless woods.  Her expression was mournful,
yet from her eyes there fell no tears.  Perhaps she felt the
humiliation of being a captive in her own duchy of Alsace.
She was dressed in a robe of light-blue Amboisienne, having
sleeves trimmed with the richest white Mechlin lace&mdash;a dress
that admirably became her pale complexion and bright golden
hair, which was shaded by a beaver, and single ostrich feather
white as snow.  The little Duke was seated near her, absorbed
in fitting and preparing for sea a toy-ship which one of
Ruthven's soldiers had made for him&mdash;a fatal gift as it
afterwards proved; and, impelled by an irresistible desire to hear
her speak, and once more meet her winning eye in kindness, I
drew near.  She bowed to me; and then I became deeply
moved when perceiving that large tears began to roll in slow
succession down her face.
</p>

<p>
'Madame,' said I, 'pardon me; but the sight of this silent
grief fills me with compassion.  Is there aught in which I can
serve you?'
</p>

<p>
'Nothing; yet I thank you, M. Blane,' was the gentle
reply.  'M. le Duc,' she added, to the little boy, who, on my
approach, had crept close to her side with childish curiosity,
'leave me, I have somewhat of importance to say to this
gentleman&mdash;to M. le Chatelain, whom you know.'
</p>

<p>
'Then will M. le Chatelain allow me to sail my new ship
in the lake, and send a soldier to take care of me?'
</p>

<p>
'Certainly, if you wish it.'
</p>

<p>
'Oh! thank you, M. le Chatelain.'
</p>

<p>
Anxious to be rid of him, I had consented, and he withdrew
to float his mimic argosie in the mountain lake that rippled
against the rampart below us.
</p>

<p>
'Hark you, M. le Duc,' said I, just as he lifted his little
ship and was running away, 'take care of yourself.'
</p>

<p>
'Why, monsieur?'
</p>

<p>
'For many reasons; you love your Duchess, do you not?'
</p>

<p>
'Oh! yes, monsieur; are not her eyes so soft and gentle?'
</p>

<p>
'Alas, yes!'
</p>

<p>
'Why <i>alas</i>?' said the child with surprise, 'I assure you,
M. le Gouverneur, she gives me twice as many sugarplums as
ever my old nurse at Toul did, especially when she begs me
not to tell any one that she has been weeping, for she weeps
very often.'
</p>

<p>
'And this is your husband, Marie Louise?' said I, as the
boy left us.
</p>

<p>
'Alas! poor child.  He is very loveable, and reminds me
much of what my foster-brother, René, and Vaudemont, were
at his age; for this I love him.'
</p>

<p>
'Unhappy girl!'
</p>

<p>
'I am indeed a most unhappy girl; yet less so than if fate
had united me to Pappenheim.'
</p>

<p>
'But this boy will be a man in time to come.'
</p>

<p>
'Ere that comes to pass I shall be&mdash;'
</p>

<p>
'Where?'  'In my grave, beside my mother.'
</p>

<p>
Her voice stirred all my old love within me, and her grief
became painfully sympathetic.  I took her soft velvet hands
in mine.  She allowed me to retain them, and, fortunately,
where we stood no eye could overlook us.  I was about to
yield to the intoxication of the moment, and press her to my
breast, when a step rang on the gravel, and the little Duke
came running back in high glee to announce that his 'ship
was afloat, and that we could see her by simply looking over
the parapet.'
</p>

<p>
'Ah!  M. le Chatelain,' said he, joyously, 'I see you are
very fond of talking to Madame la Duchesse.  So am I, for
since I lost my mother, no lady has been so kind to me as dear
Louise.  I am her husband, to be sure, but you see, monsieur,
that I am still a very little boy.  Do you love my wife?  I
am sure that <i>I</i> do; but she weeps often, and that makes me
sad.  I wish monsieur could cure her of weeping.  She kisses
me at night, when the master of the household puts me to bed
in yonder lonely turret; but I always steal to her room in the
morning, though I am sure to find her weeping.'
</p>

<p>
'You perceive, Arthur, that even this child observes my
misery.'
</p>

<p>
I pressed her hands, and felt almost stifled by her emotions
and my own.
</p>

<p>
'See, madame! see, M. le Chatelain, how bravely my ship
crosses the lake!' exclaimed the little Duke, while clapping his
hands in boyish glee he left us, and rushed again to the
postern gate, which opened close to the water.
</p>

<p>
'Leave me now, Arthur; what more could you eay to me
now, now when&mdash;all is over?'
</p>

<p>
'My God!  I know not unless&mdash;'  'Unless what?'
</p>

<p>
'That I have the misfortune to be one of those, who, if
noticed by princesses, are seldom happy enough to be long
remembered by them.'
</p>

<p>
'Ah! why did you come near me again&mdash;and with these
reproaches, too?'
</p>

<p>
'We cannot at all times control our hearts; and though
mine is all but broken, I cannot remain separate from her who
wrought me all this suffering and calamity.'
</p>

<p>
'Do you forgive me?' she sobbed.
</p>

<p>
'Forgive you&mdash;Oh, Marie Louise!'
</p>

<p>
'Alas, Arthur&mdash;you must&mdash;you would, indeed, if you knew
all I have undergone.'
</p>

<p>
To resist the impulse that inspired us both to indulge in
one mute embrace, was impossible; but how terribly was it
interrupted!
</p>

<p>
At that moment there was a piercing cry from the rocks
below.  I sprang upon the parapet, and saw the little Duke
d'Alsace struggling wildly with the waters of the lake into
which he had fallen from a point of rock, when stooping over
it, to land that fatal toy, his ship.  The soldier who had
accompanied him was hallooing vehemently for assistance, and
a loud uproar of voices shook the whole castle.  The Duke
was fully three hundred yards from me, and I stood gazing at
him, overwhelmed by many terrible emotions.
</p>

<p>
If that child was drowned, Marie Louise would be FREE;
but if I permitted him to perish without a struggle, then
would I be guilty of a wicked murder, and a dereliction of
duty.  Without longer hesitation I flung my sword, belt, and
pourpoint upon the terrace, and springing over the rampart, to
which Marie Louise was clinging, and looking paler than
white marble, I plunged headlong into the lake, and on rising
to the surface, struck out boldly for the drowning boy, who
had now risen, and sunk thrice.
</p>

<p>
'Oh, yours is indeed a noble heart!' I heard Marie Louise
cry from the wall above me, while, half blinded and suffocated
by emotion and exertion, I swam with all my force.  I saw
another person spring into the lake with a loud halloo; but
knew not, until afterwards, that he was Frank Ruthven, of
Ramsay's Musketeers, who, being a swimmer more able than
I, first reached the spot where the boy had now sunk, and it
was fatally near the brink of the cascade, over which, despite
all our efforts, the poor victim was swept and drowned.
</p>

<h3>
CHAPTER LXXI.
<br /><br />
THE VISCOUNT'S ADVICE.
</h3>

<p>
Succeeding events passed with such rapidity, that I may be
pardoned in noting them briefly.
</p>

<p>
Next day, my soldiers found the body of the Duke in the
stream below the tower, and bore it into Lutzelstein.
</p>

<p>
Marie Louise, being naturally warm-hearted and affectionate,
wept for the poor boy's death, and wreathed a chaplet
of white roses for his head when we coffined him; and with
every honour that the emergencies of the time, and the slender
nature of my garrison would admit, we buried him at a little
chapel of St. Nicolas that stood on the mountains, about three
miles distant; and there Father Colville said all the necessary
prayers.
</p>

<p>
During three or four days after the funeral, I left Marie
Louise in undisturbed seclusion, to recover her composure,
after the excitement consequent to this (in conventional
phraseology) fatal event, which set her <i>free</i>; and which, I
fear me, I was too selfish to wish undone; though salving my
conscience by the reflection that I had left nothing
unattempted to save the child who had perished; and from my
soul I thanked heaven, that in the first natural impulse of
generosity and humanity, I had plunged into the lake, and
been the first to attempt his rescue.
</p>

<p>
Without other emotion than tenderness and respect, I had
beheld Marie Louise kiss the white brow of the dead child&mdash;her
spouse&mdash;as the poor little fellow lay in the rough coffin
my soldiers had fashioned for him.
</p>

<p>
As captain of Lutzelstein I acted chief mourner.
</p>

<p>
So ended this tragedy!
</p>

<p>
I was now, however, less anxious for the arrival of my
successor, and hoped that my application might be overlooked
by the Marquis, or rejected by Lavalette.  So true it
is, that we never know the events a day may bring forth!
</p>

<p>
My new wishes in the matter proved futile; for one
morning I was awakened at daybreak, by my chamber-door
being noisily opened, and the tall form of Dundrennan,
in the cuirass and helmet of the Garde du Corps Ecossais,
stood before me.  The words of welcome I would have
spoken, died away on my lips, unuttered; for I knew that
his arrival announced an indefinite separation from Marie
Louise.
</p>

<p>
'What,' said he, 'still a-bed, as if you were in Paris!'
</p>

<p>
'I have so little to care for here, at Lutzelstein.'
</p>

<p>
'How, so little say you, when your fair friend&mdash;a veritable
princess&mdash;is here, and a widow too!'
</p>

<p>
I shrugged my shoulders.
</p>

<p>
'How French you have become,' said the jovial Viscount;
'but say, has not your suit prospered since the drowning of
her juvenile spouse?'
</p>

<p>
'Hush!' said I; 'do not speak thus, for heaven's sake!'
</p>

<p>
'Devil take me, if I understand thee, Arthur Blane!'
grumbled the Viscount, biting his dark moustache; 'but
rouse thee, man, truss thy points, and let us to breakfast.  I
have had a long ride overnight from Seltz, which we captured
at our swords' point three days ago.  Old Patrick Gordon
lost an ear by a pistol-shot, in the assault; but the cuirassiers
expect you anon; for it seems that I am to be your successor,
for a little time, in this detestable place.  Ouf!  But Madame
la Duchesse d'Alsace&mdash;by Jove! it <i>will</i> be awkward for me
to have such a charming prisoner in my care&mdash;one who is
another's lady love, too!'
</p>

<p>
'Dundrennan, your gabble tortures me,' said I, springing
from bed, and proceeding hurriedly to dress.
</p>

<p>
'I had a narrow escape in the assault, for Ramsay's Scots
blew up the powder-magazine&mdash;a pleasant little piece of
excitement, which cost twenty of them their lives.  But how
have you wearied of your captaincie?'
</p>

<p>
'Because I am weary of my life.'
</p>

<p>
'With a prisoner so fair in ward&mdash;a widow, a virgin widow
too&mdash;lovely in her weeds and tears!'
</p>

<p>
'Dundrennan, I will kill you!'
</p>

<p>
'No, you will not; but you shall listen to me and to reason.'
</p>

<p>
'Reason from you, Viscount?'
</p>

<p>
'Yes,' said he, becoming grave; 'is your passion real?'
</p>

<p>
'Alas, too real!'
</p>

<p>
'Then conquer it, if it cannot prosper.'
</p>

<p>
'Folly, Viscount&mdash;a real passion cannot be conquered; a
fanciful one can alone be stifled.'
</p>

<p>
'This love affair has been a misfortune to you both, Arthur.'
</p>

<p>
'True, Viscount; but we cannot control our hearts.'
</p>

<p>
'We&mdash;then the lady fully responds?'
</p>

<p>
'Oh, yes&mdash;as much as lover could desire.'
</p>

<p>
'You are riddles!  She must be won by a coup-de-main, or
she will soon be taken from you, and then you will be
compelled to forget her.'
</p>

<p>
'Impossible!' said I, buckling my sword-belt over my
pourpoint.
</p>

<p>
'So you think; but nothing is impossible to time.  Learn
to love her at a distance; her image will then fade gradually,
while another may soon supplant it; for the human heart
cannot remain long vacant.'
</p>

<p>
I shook my head sorrowfully.
</p>

<p>
'Well&mdash;I have but one other advice to offer.'
</p>

<p>
'And that is&mdash;'
</p>

<p>
'To carry her off while there is yet time.  With such a
prize to win, and such a love already won, with swords enough
to back me, I would bear her off before the assembled kings of
Europe.'
</p>

<p>
'You counsel boldly, Dundrennan.'
</p>

<p>
'Because I counsel wisely.  Women will forgive everything
that has love for an excuse.  Let us be bold in love as in war.
A little modest assurance in the flowery field of Venus will
carry one on, when modest merit fails to win the day.'
</p>

<p>
'You talk like the ruffs and gallants of the Boulevards.
But ah, Viscount! you do not know Marie Louise.  Every
thought of hers is full of innocence&mdash;every action full of
charm and grace.'
</p>

<p>
'Of course,' chimed Dundrennan, stroking his moustache
with a very provoking air; but at that moment Frank Ruthven
appeared to announce that four strange horsemen, richly
dressed, well armed and mounted, were at the gate of the
tower, and imperiously demanding admittance.
</p>

<p>
'Which way came they?' I asked, assuming my sword and
mantle.
</p>

<p>
'By the road from Lorraine.'
</p>

<p>
'They have come from Paris,' said Dundrennan.
</p>

<p>
'Probably,' said I, and a gloomy foreboding of their
mission sank like a cloud over my heart.

<h3>
CHAPTER LXXII.
<br /><br />
THE KING'S MANDATE.
</h3>

<p>
These four horsemen were from Paris direct, and proved to
be M. de Brissac, a Commander of Notre Dame de Mont Carmel,
and two grey musketeers, gentlemen in the suite of Cardinal
Richelieu, who came as commissioners, with a warrant
to convey Marie Louise of Lorraine, daughter of Duke Charles
IV., and her husband the Duke d'Alsace, direct, under
suitable escort, to the capital, where they were to be delivered to
the captain of the <i>Bastille</i>!
</p>

<p>
As I read over the warrant, and with a sickening heart
handed it to Dundrennan, to whom, as new chatelain of
Lutzelstein, it was more immediately addressed, I felt a strong
desire to pass my sword in succession through the bodies of
M. De Brissac, the unfortunate Knight of Our Lady of Mont
Carmel, and their two companions.
</p>

<p>
'Dundrennan,' I whispered, 'what shall we do?'
</p>

<p>
'Receive the King's mandate with respect in the first place,
and promise implicit obedience in the second; but whether we
shall see fit to fulfil that promise, is a matter for future
consideration.  Gentlemen,' said he, turning to the four visitors, 'I
am Viscount Dundrennan, a gentleman of the Garde du Corps
Ecossais, now captain of this tower, and shall see that our fair
prisoner is duly apprised of your arrival, and of the King's kind
views concerning her and the little Duke, who is now happily
beyond the reach even of Cardinal Richelieu.  When do you
propose returning towards Paris?'
</p>

<p>
'To-night, if possible,' said De Brissac.
</p>

<p>
'Pardieu! my dear De Brissac,' exclaimed the knight of
Mont Carmel, 'don't speak yet of returning, before we have
almost seated ourselves.'
</p>

<p>
'Of course, gentlemen, you will breakfast with us?'
</p>

<p>
'With pleasure.  I have tasted nothing since we supped at
a wayside auberge yesterday, where we had to cook the fowls
for ourselves.'
</p>

<p>
'And you pronounced them delicious, M. le Chevalier, and
gave all the heads and legs to the aubergiste, with your
customary liberality.'
</p>

<p>
'De Brissac!' I muttered, 'this caterer for the Bastille, is,
like De Bitche, my evil genius.'
</p>

<p>
'Hush!' said Dundrennan; 'any display of hostility will
spoil the plan of my intended campaign.  I mean you to play
a little game with these four commissioners, as the warrant of
Louis, "by God's grace, King of France and Navarre,"
styles them.  So, gentlemen, what is the latest news from
the vicinity of Notre Dame?'
</p>

<p>
'The same as ever,' replied the commander of Mont Carmel;
'the star of La Comtesse d'Amboise is still in the ascendant.'
</p>

<p>
'King Louis still reigns in the bosoms of his subjects&mdash;the
female portion thereof especially,' said De Brissac.
</p>

<p>
'For shame, De Brissac; this is "lese Majesty."'
</p>

<p>
'Nay, 'tis a melancholy truism.'
</p>

<p>
'And Monseigneur le Cardinal still worships at the shrine of
Marion de l'Orme?' said I, with a spiteful glance at De Brissac.
</p>

<p>
'Oh yes, M. Blane!' said he, with a covert smile; 'and
has employed M. Poussin to paint two classic subjects from
ancient history for her boudoir.'
</p>

<p>
'The sorrows of the chaste Lucretia, perhaps?'
</p>

<p>
'No: Nero, after his first shave, presenting his soapsuds
to thundering Jove in the Capitol; and Caligula making love
to the moon, and beseeching her to enter his bed.'
</p>

<p>
There was an undefinable something in the jaunty air and
jocular tone of De Brissac that irritated me, I scarcely knew
why; so I said&mdash;'You and I had a little affair left
unsettled in Paris, M. de Brissac, if I remember rightly.'
</p>

<p>
'I was just about to recall it to your memory, and regret
that you have but anticipated me.  You consider me still
your debtor?'  'I do,' was the haughty reply.
</p>

<p>
'And wish to fight with me?'  'Yes,' I replied, heedless of
a twitch Dundrennan gave my cloak.
</p>

<p>
'Then I regret, M. Blane, that I must decline the honor
of crossing swords with you.'  'Zounds!&mdash;decline?'
</p>

<p>
'For a little time yet.'  'Indeed!&mdash;wherefore?'
</p>

<p>
'Pardieu&mdash;for two sufficient reasons.'  'Name them.'
</p>

<p>
'If I killed you, people in Paris would say I had done so
because you demurred to let king Louis have the daughter of
Duke Charles.  If you killed me they would say it was
done because I came to demand her, or that you resented
being omitted in this pressing invitation to share the
hospitality of the Bastille; moreover, they will put unpleasant
constructions on the circumstance of the duke d'Alsace being
drowned while in your care.  They are very provoking, these
Parisians, so let our little quarrel remain open until you
return to the Louvre, when I will be delighted to afford you
an opportunity of going comfortably home upon a door or
shutter from the Boulevards or the Bois de Boulogne.'
</p>

<p>
'Agreed,' said I, for one part of his remarks made me grow
pale with anxiety; 'but will you please to inform me what
interest these devilish gossips of Paris can conceive me to have
in withstanding the King's orders concerning Marie Louise of
Lorraine?'
</p>

<p>
'My dear young friend,' said De Brissac, laughing, as he
seated himself at table, 'your residence here among these
wooded mountains is very secluded; but, believe me, that
Cardinal Richelieu has more spies in France and Germany
than Father du Tremblay, that devil of a Capuchin.'
</p>

<p>
I retired, and was followed by Dundrennan, who said to
me, gravely&mdash;
</p>

<p>
'Be silent and be wary, for that you are suspected at Paris
is but too evident.'
</p>

<p>
I threw myself upon a fauteuil to unravel and consider the
difficulties of my new position, while the Viscount visited the
poor victim of all these wars and politics to announce her
intended removal to Paris and to the Bastille.  Her first
emotions were anger and alarm, then grief and shame at the
idea of being immured in that atrocious prison; and she burst
into a flood of tears.
</p>

<p>
'I have but my old advice to offer,' said Dundrennan, as he
rejoined me; 'marry her, and trust the sequel to Providence
and the heels of a good horse.'
</p>

<p>
'So be if, then, Viscount; I love her too dearly to
surrender her again.  I have twice lost her, I may say&mdash;once
I deemed for ever.  You alone know this secret, Dundrennan,
and must befriend us.'
</p>

<p>
'You heard De Brissac's mysterious hints about Richelieu
and the gossips of Paris.'
</p>

<p>
'True!' said I, stamping my foot; 'bear with me like a
friend&mdash;advise me like a brother.'
</p>

<p>
'My advice is already given&mdash;marry and levant from
Lutzelstein, leaving De Brissac to return to Paris from
a bootless errand.  Twenty leagues from Seltz, on the
Baden side of the Rhine, my cousin, Marmaduke Maxwell,
commands an imperial garrison at Lieben-Zell; I will give
you letters to him.  Once with him you will be safe, for he will
put you and your bride on the way to Flanders, from the
coast of which you can easily obtain shipping for Scotland.'
</p>

<p>
'And if once again I place my foot on the Galloway hills,
I may defy alike the Emperor and Duke Charles.  I have
run enough about the world, and seen enough of bloodshed.
Yes, yes,' I added, with a glow of joy, 'I will go home once
more to the glen where my forefathers sleep under the shadow
of the old village spire.'
</p>

<p>
While Dundrennan went in search of Father Colville to
talk with him on the crisis of our affairs&mdash;for as a Scottish
peer he had great influence with the priest&mdash;I repaired, with
an anxious heart, to the presence of Marie Louise.
</p>

<p><br /><br /><br /></p>

<p><a id="chap73"></a></p>

<h3>
CHAPTER LXXIII.
<br /><br />
HOW WE OBEYED IT.
</h3>

<p>
I found her pale and in tears, with a face that too plainly
told of present suffering and of past sorrow.  She was dressed
in a dark robe, having wide loose sleeves trimmed with silver
braid and black wolf's fur, which contrasted finely with the
whiteness of her delicate skin.  She came hurriedly towards
me, and putting both her soft hands in mine permitted me to
kiss them and place myself beside her.  After a sad
pause,&mdash;'Viscount Dundrennan has just left me,' said she.
</p>

<p>
'Then you know all?'
</p>

<p>
'All that Richelieu and King Louis have in store for me&mdash;yes.
Imprisonment in the Bastille until I shall consent,
perhaps, to wed one of their creatures, or until my father, to
procure my release, consents to a written surrender of that
dukedom which has already been rent from him by force of
arms.'
</p>

<p>
Her tears flowed fast; and I pressed her hand to my heart,
saying,&mdash;
</p>

<p>
'Alas!  Marie Louise, that you should weep thus&mdash;you
who have been born to rank and splendour.'
</p>

<p>
'Nay&mdash;I have been born to unhappiness&mdash;born of a race
that is fated to fall.'
</p>

<p>
'Louise, listen to me,' said I, trembling for the success of
what I was about to propose; but yielding to the dangerous
predicament in which we stood; trusting to her love for me,
and borne away by my passion for her, heaven lent me
eloquence, and the little I said when urging her to marry, and
with me to seek safely in flight, was said well and delicately;
but all that interview seemed like a dream to me an hour after.
</p>

<p>
She grew pale as snow, and trembled in her turn; but my
words had not been heard unheeded.
</p>

<p>
'Much as I love you, Arthur, and that I do love you, you
believe and know, there is a something in all this proceeding
at which my pride revolts.'
</p>

<p>
She paused, and my heart sunk; but suddenly she kissed
me; her eyes beamed with a beautiful expression, and taking
my hands in hers, site said,&mdash;
</p>

<p>
'You would have married me when you believed me to be
but a poor soubrette, dear Arthnr&mdash;you, a gentleman of
family; a cuirassier of the proud Garde du Corps Ecossais;
I have not forgotten that, or that to be ungenerous would be
unlike the daughter of Duke Charles.  A pure passion, a true
love, should ever be ready to make every temporal sacrifice
for the object of its regard; but this is no sacrifice that you
ask me&mdash;to fly with you to your country&mdash;this Scotland of
which we hear so much in song and war.  I ask you to give
me a protector; to save me from the Bastille, from Richelieu,
and from Louis&mdash;from becoming again the wedded victim of
a sinking state.'
</p>

<p>
'Heaven bless you, beloved Louise!  This, then, casts the
die and decides me.  No man can serve two masters.'
</p>

<p>
'What mean you, Arthur?'
</p>

<p>
'I cannot obey love and Louis XIII. at the same time.'
</p>

<p>
'What will the world say, on hearing that after being but
three weeks a widow I wedded again?'
</p>

<p>
'It will say that your so-called husband was but a child;
that you were made the sport of circumstances and the tool of
calculating politicians, who snared you into so preposterous
an espousal.'
</p>

<p>
'Perhaps so,' she sobbed upon my breast; 'but my
father&mdash;&mdash;'  'Is a fugitive.'
</p>

<p>
'My poor father! so brave, so true, and tender!  I shall
never see his kind face again; but surely, to be the wife of a
well-tried soldier&mdash;&mdash;'
</p>

<p>
'Will be no disgrace in the eyes of Charles of Lorraine,' I
added.
</p>

<p>
'Neither Louis nor my father shall have it in their power
to make me the wife of a man I cannot love.  My family are
exiled; Lorraine is now but a name&mdash;a French province; its
dukedom is a shadow.  We are equal; and your country and
home, dear Arthur, shall henceforth be mine!'
</p>

<p>
After this I need scarcely add more; but we had De
Brissac and his three companions to baffle, the Rhine to
cross, Flanders to traverse, and the sea to pass before we saw
my father's tower amid the wilds of Glenkens; and many a
bold and daring adventure we had on the journey&mdash;adventures
sufficient to fill ten such volumes as this.
</p>

<p class="t3">
&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;
</p>

<p>
Marie Louise was a true woman; thus, when I appealed to
her love and her generosity cold reason gave way, and she
agreed to unite her fortunes with me.
</p>

<p>
Love on one hand, with the Bastille on the other, were
powerful arguments; and if any more were required Father
Colville of the Scottish College of Pontamoussin supplied
them; for he had great influence with her, and was warmly
disposed towards me.  The priest knew that he owed perhaps
too much to Duke Charles to free him from some blame in
wedding his daughter to me without a special permission; but
considering that by doing so he advanced, as he said in his
own quaint way, 'the honour, comfort, and commoditie of a
Scottish gentleman,' he had no qualms in the matter, spiritual
or temporal, and at once agreed to bless the indissoluble knot.
</p>

<p>
Brevity is necessary now, for my volume is already full.
</p>

<p>
We were married that evening in the little oratory of
Lutzelstein, at the door of which stood Frank Ruthven, with his
sword drawn, to prevent espionage or interruption; and the
sole witnesses were Richard Maxwell Viscount of Dundrennan,
and the attendant of Marie Louise, a young lady of the
province, named Anna Mulhausen, daughter of the Grand Bailiff
of Alsace, a flaxen-haired little beauty who loved her mistress
well, and whom we easily bound to solemn secresy.
</p>

<p>
Our next achievement was to baffle the acuteness of M. de
Brissac, who proposed to leave with his prisoner when the
moon rose, that he might travel as far as possible unseen.  It
was resolved, that as we could not leave this solitary tower
unknown to him, we should by a ruse elude his vigilance.
Thus: he was to be permitted to hand Marie Louise into the
coach on one side of the dark and narrow archway of the
outworks, when she would leave it in a moment and unseen, by
the <i>other</i>.  My heart beat quickly and painfully as the sunset
deepened on the mountains; as the moon arose, the night drew
on and the moment of escape approached when Marie Louise
and I would be together&mdash;together and cast upon the world
never in life to be separated more!  I carefully examined the
two horses Dundrennan kept for us at the back postern of the
tower; I inspected every buckle of their bridles and girths; I
armed myself carefully, like one about to engage in a deadly
struggle, and double-charged my girdle and holster pistols.
</p>

<p>
The rumble of wheels in the court-yard, announced that the
old-fashioned coach in which we had captured Marie Louise
was being prepared for her again; and the glare of torches
on the walls and grated windows of the tower, with the clatter
of hoofs, informed me that the horses of De Brissac, of the
Chevalier of Notre Dame de Mont Carmel, and of the two
grey mousquetaires were ready.
</p>

<p>
Ah, what a breathless and exciting time it was!
Luckily the moon became veiled in clouds, and Dundrennan
ordered all the torches to be extinguished, saying, with a
wink to me, that 'the vaults were full of live bombs and
gunpowder.'
</p>

<p>
I felt almost suffocated with excitement and apprehension,
as Marie Louise, in her travelling dress, came forth; and
instinctively I stepped towards her.
</p>

<p>
'Keep back, Blane,' whispered Dundrennan; 'your
excitement will spoil all&mdash;leave me to officiate.'
</p>

<p>
Drawn by four horses, the large old-fashioned coach stood
in the dark and narrow archway of the tower; and De Brissac,
an old hand in all manner of business connected with arrestments
and the Bastille, said, with the greatest suavity of tone
and manner,
</p>

<p>
'Pardon me, madame!' and lifted her veil to assure himself
that this lady was indeed his prisoner.  The blue eyes, the
pale face, and golden hair were seen for a moment, and a cry
almost escaped me as with one hand he assisted her into the
coach, and while carefully closing the door, with the other
gave to Dundrennan, as captain of Lutzelstein, a full receipt
for 'the person of Marie Louise of Lorraine;' and I heard
the Viscount laugh as he placed it in his girdle, and walked
round to the other door of the carriage, which he had purposely
left open; and then my heart stood still, for one false or
unanticipated movement would spoil all!  M. De Brissac
said&mdash;
</p>

<p>
'Adieu, for to-night, madame! after this we shall disturb
you no more until morning.'
</p>

<p>
Placing a foot in his stirrup he mounted, and ordered the
coach to be driven off.  At the same moment I lifted Marie
Louise out by the opposite door, which Dundrennan closed as
I led her away in the darkness, which enabled this manoeuvre
to be as skilfully executed as it was wisely prepared; and
then the enormous vehicle went lumbering empty along the
bridge of the cascade and down the valley, carefully guarded
by De Brissac, the Chevalier of Mont Carmel, and the two
mousquetaires.
</p>

<p>
'I have the quittance of M. de Brissac; I am safe&mdash;the
fool! the egregious fool!' said Dundrennan, while, laughing,
he ordered the gates to be shut and the bridge wound up.
'Now, Blane, my dear friend, to horse, and away for the
Rhine.'
</p>

<p>
We reached the sallyport and mounted.  Dundrennan
lifted Marie Louise to her saddle, and kissed her white and
trembling hands, which could scarcely grasp the reins.
</p>

<p>
'Adieu, madame!' said he; 'in Scotland we may meet again.'
</p>

<p>
'Farewell, Viscount!' said I; and tears started to my
eyes when I saw his tall and noble figure for the last time:
'give my kindest wishes to all our comrades of the Garde du
Corps Ecossais.  God's blessing! a long, good night to them
and you!  As the song says&mdash;
</p>

<p class="poem">
  'What I hae tint through lack o' wit,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I never, never, can recall;<br />
  I trust you'll be my friends as yet;<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gude night, and joy be wi' you all!'<br />
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
He waved his plumed hat to us as we spurred round the
margin of the lake, and in a direction opposite to that pursued
by the deluded messengers of Cardinal Richelieu, galloped in
safety down the moonlighted path that led towards the
far-famed Rhine.
</p>

<p class="t3">
&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;

<p>
<a id="conclusion"></a>
If any of my readers are curious to see in stone and
lime a corroboration of the foregoing narrative, let them
come with me to the Grampians of Galloway&mdash;to that
sequestered district so celebrated for the savage grandeur of
its scenery, and the feudal exploits of the loyal house of
Kenmure.  If my inquiring friend is a sportsman, let him not
forget his rod and gun (with sandwiches and a well-filled
pocket-pistol), for there the spotted trout, the scaly salmon, the
wild duck, the dusky coot and heron, enjoy a lonely world of
their own; and if our wanderer be (as I would prefer) one of
the fairer portion of our creation, let her not forget her
sketch-book and the language of the flowers.
</p>

<p>
There, amid the wilds of Glenkens, we will find the ruined
tower of Blanerne, above the arched door of which is a carved
scutcheon of red stone, bearing the arms of the Scottish
Blanes; to wit, in the half-obsolete slang of heraldry, <i>argent</i>,
a fesse <i>gules</i>, with a mullet between two crescents of the first;
in base, a rose of the second, quartered with the <i>three winglets of
Lorraine</i>, the whole being collared by the order of St. Lazare,
crested by a sword, and encircled by a motto, which the
venerable 'muffs' of the Lyon Court have declared to be
</p>

<p class="t3">
'HE YAT GIVES QUICKLIE, GIVES TWYSE.'
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
From the quartering of this escutcheon, as well as from
various entries in the parochial register of births, we may be
assured that Arthur Blane and his bride lived here long in
honour and happiness; but the reader may wish to know
something more of those who have borne a prominent place in
these pages.
</p>

<p>
A few lines will tell their story.
</p>

<p>
The Marquis of Gordon succeeded to the title of Huntly,
and after a long career of brilliant service, returned to
Scotland; where in 1649 he was cruelly executed for his
loyalty to the house of Stuart&mdash;the common fate of loyalty and
love of country in those days.
</p>

<p>
Patrick Gordon and Viscount Dundrennan both died for the
King at Marston Moor; while Clara D'Ische ended her days
in a convent, and was, we believe, the last favourite of Louis
XIII.
</p>

<p>
Duke Charles closed his days in 1665, after maintaining a
futile struggle for possession of his dukedom, every acre of
which was finally ceded to France by treaty in 1662.  Vaudemont
also died in exile, and after this the ancient house of
Lorraine was heard of no more.
</p>

<p>
Unlike the villains of narratives in general, the fate of De
Bitche is involved in obscurity: but it is more than probable
that he perished in the desperate war which preceded the
treaty of peace that was happily signed at Munster&mdash;thus
closing a protracted struggle, the dark shadow of which lingers
yet in Germany.

NOTES.
</h3>

<p>
1. Of the Scottish Guard of the French kings a short account has
already been given in the body of this work.  Those who wish to
see a more particular narrative of their exploits will find it in the
'History of the First Foot,' and <i>L'Escosse Française</i> of A. Houston.
In 1717 the Guard had dwindled down to four-and-twenty Scottish
gentlemen, who were commanded by the Comte de Maillé.  The
following letter or bond of service, given in 1625 by the heir of
Ardlogie to 'my Lord Gordon,' styled Marquis of Gordon in France,
will best explain the constitution of the <i>Garde du Corps Ecossais</i>
at the time of our story.
</p>

<p>
'Be it kenned to all men by these present letters, I Adam
Gordon, apparent of Ardlogie, forsomuch as it has pleased the right
noble lord, George Lord Gordon, son to the right noble marquis,
George Marquis of Huntlie and Captain-in chief of the companie of
Scottish Gensdarmes, under the most Christian king Lotus XIII. of
France and Navarre, to admit me one of the said companie, therefore
I, the said Adam Gordon, heir of Ardlogie, and also John Gordon of
Ardlogie and Patrick Gordon of Boigheidis, cautioners and suretis
for me, &amp;c., &amp;c., bind and oblige us, and ilk one of us, conjunctlie
and severallie, &amp;c., that I, the said Adam Gordon, shall <i>duly
observe and keep the whole musters, duly prepared with one man and
two horses, armed at all points, with one case of pistols</i>, at such places
and time as the said captain or commissary shall give warrant and
direction to that effect, and also, that I shall be ready and prepared
to go to France or elsewhere, to attend my service, at all occasions
whensoever I shall be required by my captain, &amp;c., upon forty days'
advertisement so to do, and in case I fail in performance of this
present bond, or any part thereof, in that case, I and my cautioners
oblige ourselves conjunctlie and severallie to content and pay to the
said captain or his assignees the sum of <i>one thousand and fiftie French

2.  The privileges of the Scots in France were most ample, and
were every way similar to those enjoyed by French subjects.  These
privileges were fully defined and confirmed by Henry, King of France
in 1558, by a letter of naturalisation registered in the Parliament
of Paris, in the Great Council and Chamber of Accompts; and in the
same year the same privileges were conferred on the French by
the Parliament of Scotland.  The French document is as follows,
briefly translated:&mdash;
</p>

<p>
'HENRI PAR LA GRACE DE DIEU ROY DE FRANCE, to all present
and to come, health.  As, since the marriage before spoken of,
between our very dear and beloved son, the royal dauphin, and our
very dear and beloved daughter, the dauphiness and queen of
Scotland, his spouse, the deputies of the estates of her kingdom
have made the oath of fidelity to my son as their true and natural
lord; by means of this, the subjects of the two realms (which have
now long been allied in mutual friendship, favouring and succouring
each other) will have permission to approach the royal families of
Scotland and France, as if they were one, and desiring, for the better
establishment of this league, and to fortify this friendship between
our dear subjects, and those of the kingdom of Scotland, and to
afford the inhabitants of that loyal country greater facility for
visiting the king and queen, when they wish to do so, or of residing
near them, or of seeing them, as good and loyal subjects, we give
them the same favours, graces, and privileges which are enjoyed by
our own people.
</p>

<p>
'We, having considered these things, and for several other great
and reasonable causes, give all the inhabitants of the kingdom of
Scotland, subjects of our son, the royal dauphin, and our dear
daughter, his wife, permission, by this our authority, to reside and
remain in this our kingdom, to have, hold, and possess, any benefice,
dignity, or ecclesiastical office, which they can justly and canonically
attain, <i>les bons titres</i>, which are not contrary to the privileges of the
church in France, and to keep and enjoy, and to receive and uplift,
the fruits and revenues thereof.
</p>

<p>
'They may also acquire in this kingdom lands or seigneuries
under us, all and each of these goods, moveable and immoveable,
together with all they may gain by gift or succession, <i>we give them
permission to dispose of by last will or otherwise, as they wish</i>, and
that their heirs, or others, to whom they may dispose of them, can
succeed, take, and keep possession of their gifts, like other natives of
our kingdom, without our Procureur General, or any other officer
hereafter acquiring any right of interference; and that the subjects
of the kingdom of Scotland may enjoy their benefits without
molestation.  And to all those who wish it, we ordain that they
may possess in our kingdom lands and seigneuries, as in the
kingdom of Scotland; but subject to our obedience, without being
questioned or paying to our successors any indemnity, the sum or value
of which we have, in consideration, discharged in favour of our
dear son and daughter, by this present act, signed under our hand.
We announce to all judges, and others whom it may concern, &amp;c.,
to the courts of Parliament, Grand Council, and Accompts of Paris,
to all our bailiffs, seneschals, prevosts, and others, our justiciars
and officers, or their lieutenants, present and to come, that of our
kindness, we give licence and permission to all the inhabitants of the
kingdom of Scotland to enjoy these benefits peaceably and without
molestation, for such is our will and pleasure, &amp;c., &amp;c.
</p>

<p>
'<i>Donné à Villiers-cousterez, au mois de Juin, l'an de grace mil
cinq cents cinquante et huict.  Et de nostre regne le douziésme.</i>'
</p>

<p>
Until the Revolution, the effects of all strangers, <i>Scots excepted</i>,
dying in France were liable to seizure by the law of the land,
though the heir was upon the spot; and the reader may remember
Sterne's indignant outburst on this subject in the introduction to his
'Sentimental Journey.'  Many traces of the ancient Scoto-French
alliance may be found in Scotland, and the memory of it lingers
yet in the hearts and traditions of the peasantry in the south of
France, who still remember the achievements of the Garde du Corps
Ecossais.

Depuis ce temps, le Gouvernement a fait faire une grande restoration,
qui a fait connaître exactement le lieu où votre compatriote a
été inhumé.

Mais le cercucil a été scrupuleusement respecté, et le caveau
exactement refermé, et le lieu reste dans l'état ancien, jusqu'à ce que
le ministère aura pris une détermination sur la restoration de la
partie de l'édifice où se trouve le tombeau; le monument a probablement
été détruit par la tourmente révolutionnaire de '93: l'année
prochaine, je pourrai vous communiquer la description exacte du
cercueil et de la pierre qui a été cachée, en grande partie, par
d'énormes bois d'échafaudage.

'Aujourd'hui, je puis vous faire connaîre l'inscription, qui est sur
une plaque de plomb, placée sur le cercueil, vous la trouverez
ci-dessous.

displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.
</div>

This website includes information about Project Gutenberg&#8482;,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
